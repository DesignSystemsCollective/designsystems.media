    "description": "When designing for a specific user group, we often tend to generalise, following assumptions, biases and stereotypes. So how do we design effectively to invite a use group and broaden our user base? How do we design for children and teenagers? How do we adjust our content and design for Gen-Z? What should we keep in mind for older adults? And what about people who have to make critical decisions under stress and time pressure?\nHow should our products adapt for people who are deaf, autistic and neurodivergent?\n\nIn this session, Vitaly dives into practical design patterns to design better ‚Äî and help everyone get their tasks done better and faster. With plenty of real-life examples and UX guidelines that you can apply to your work right away.\n\n----   \n\nAbout Vitaly Friedman\n\nVitaly loves beautiful content and does not give up easily. Born in Minsk, Belarus, he studied computer science and mathematics in Germany. While writing algebra proofs and preparing for software engineering at nights in the kitchen, at the same time he discovered passion for typography, interface design and writing. After working as a freelance designer and developer for 6 years, he co-founded Smashing Magazine back in 2006, a leading online magazine for designers and developers. His curiosity drove him from interface design to front-end to performance optimization to accessibility and back to user experience over all the years.\n\nVitaly is the author, co-author and editor of Smashing books, and a curator of Smashing Conferences. He is creative lead of Smashing Magazine and front-end/UX consultant with the European Parliament and Smashing Media, in Europe and abroad, working with Haufe-Lexware, Axel-Springer and a few other companies.\n\nHe also runs Measure UX and Smart Interface Design Patterns, friendly video libraries on UX and design patterns, along with a live UX training for UX and product designers.\n\nOh, and surely you don‚Äôt want to miss his full-day workshop at beyond tellerrand titled ‚ÄúDesigning For Complex UIs In 2025‚Äù.\n\n----  \n\nThis presentation was given at the \"beyond tellerrand\" festival 2025 in D√ºsseldorf.   \n\nMore information about beyond tellerrand (#btconf in short) here:   \nhttps://beyondtellerrand.com  \n\nbeyond tellerrand is the affordable single-track event where creativity and technology meet in a renowned, familiar and friendly atmosphere.  \n\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/beyondtellerrand/   \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/btconf   \nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/beyondtellerrand.com   \nMastodon: https://mastodon.social/@btconf   \n\n----   \n\nIntro (part of the live performed opening titles) by @GavStrange \n\nFilming: Stefan Nitzsche (@ambimyth8746)",

Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.\n\nKevin Coyle (He/Him) Big Medium\n\nFrom the rhythmic clatter of a lone developer‚Äôs IBM keyboard in a dimly-lit cubicle office to the overwhelming complexity of large Scrum teams comprising frontend specialists, backend engineers, scrum masters, and product managers, the landscape of web development has undergone a dramatic evolution. This change has led to increasing siloization, creating divisions among product management, frontend and backend development, and design. As a result, communication has, in some cases, become a formidable barrier. Simple issues can lead to hours-long meetings, where presentations are painstakingly reinterpreted and translated for different interest groups, resulting in wasted time and mounting frustration. In this talk, we‚Äôll explore how we got to this point and what tools have aided us along the way, including the invention of design systems for taxonomy and tools that serve as translation layers between developers and designers. Finally, and most intriguingly, we‚Äôll delve into the exciting new developments in artificial intelligence. We‚Äôll investigate whether AI could be the missing link that not only streamlines our workflows but also fosters more effective human-to-human communication.\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

Designers craft well-rounded, accessible components that engineers then build. Designers and engineers also outline props and APIs, document usage guidelines, develop token naming conventions, and more. But design systems are supposed to be a product‚Äîso, how about we treat them that way by assigning content experts? Stop the madness of designers and engineers taking on secondary roles outside their area of expertise, leading to team inefficiencies and crankiness.\n\nIn this session, Natalie will discuss the benefits of integrating content within design systems. Drawing from her own experience, she‚Äôll illustrate how dedicated content support allows each discipline to excel, enhances the overall user experience, and ultimately sets design system teams up for greater success.\n\n\nCONVERGE 2024\nAt Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems‚Äîinspiring excellence in design systems.

But what about managing assignments, tracking tasks, and discussing status? The momentum of emergent tokens and rapid Figma and code prototypes gives way to the dulling rigor of quality and collaboration across designers and developers wanting to operate independently. In order to earn trust and reach success, design systems need to sweat the details together. Managing the work need not be so daunting and tedious.\n\nIn this talk, Nathan will demonstrate the process he‚Äôs installed and evolved across the design system teams he‚Äôs led over the past ten years. Using tools like Asana and Jira, he‚Äôll demonstrate how to organize design system work, record scope, assign and track tasks, and release features over time. Workflow challenges ‚Äì repetitive reviews, quick tasks amid formal workflows, when to discuss requests ‚Äì will season the tour. Whether you are a system practitioner considering how you fit or a manager refining a practice, you‚Äôll leave inspired to refine the speed, precision and clarity of your design system process.\n\nCONVERGE 2024\nAt Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems‚Äîinspiring excellence in design systems.

However, designers, engineers and product owners are built to challenge assumptions ‚Äì and when we launched our design system, they did exactly that. In fact, we launched our design system many times over the last 8 years, and we continue to face into challenges surrounding adoption today.

She recounts being inspired by her mother sewing and her own experiences running a personal style program, and how frustrations with ill-fitting off-the-rack clothing got her to take up the hobby. Elyse reflects on the highs and lows of learning the craft, from her initial overconfidence after sewing a tote bag to grappling with failed projects, and her breakthrough with a simple yet satisfying project, which became a stylish staple and a symbol of her progress. Along the way, she gained a new appreciation for the craftsmanship behind fashion and the ethics of sustainable clothing.\n\nGuest Bio\nElyse Holladay (she/her) is a long-time Design Systems practitioner and speaker, currently the solo Design Systems engineer at Color Health. She was tapped to start the first Design System team for Indeed, has taught hundreds of hours of technical training content, and has been invited to speak at well-known industry events such as Clarity Conference, CSSConf Berlin, and Frontend Design Conference. She's a technical generalist who can flex between design, code, glue work, and OKRs, once quit tech to build a personal style program, is an off-the-charts extrovert, avid reader, and expat Texan with an armadillo tattoo.\n\nLinks\nElyse‚Äôs website: https://www.elyseholladay.com/\nElyse on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/elyseholladay/\n\nCredits\nCover design by Raquel Breternitz.",

On this episode of The Design Systems Podcast, Chris Strahl sits down with Ben Callahan, co-founder of Sparkbox, to explore the critical role of language and communication in team dynamics, problem-solving, and system structures. Ben shares insights on how linguistic choices shape product creation and drive organization-wide cohesion. He argues that while common ground is essential, design systems should balance order with controlled \"quenched disorder\" to foster innovation, using flexible, layered structures that adapt to unique team needs and create scalable, culturally embedded solutions. Listen to the full episode to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between language, design systems, and organizational culture, as well as practical insights on fostering system adoption and cross-team collaboration.\n\nView the transcript (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XW9KzRBwsf82UPw-wze5TPE1PY_ww_iyuRYQDfF2jMk/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.m7y63er2g4ty)  of this episode.\n\n\nCheck out our upcoming events (https://www.knapsack.cloud/events) .\n\n\n\nGuest\nBen Callahan (https://bencallahan.com/)  is a developer, designer, and founder of Sparkbox (https://sparkbox.com/) , known for his engaging presentations, workshops, and his interactive series The Question (https://us9.list-manage.com/survey?u=0f766efbf71b1e45af76b770b&id=eb63354558&attribution=false) .

She has worn several hats, from product designer to design manager to design ops manager. She leads the DEI committee at zeroheight and career coaches underrepresented communities in tech. She also cohosts several design-related podcasts and runs a meetup called Hella Design Systems. As an environmental justice advocate, she works to provide tree equity in Oakland, California.\n\nLuke (they/them) currently leads the Marketing team at zeroheight. Before zeroheight, Luke has worked as an IC and leader in product design and advocacy teams at Memrise, Mr & Mrs Smith and Microsoft. They co-host too many podcasts and co-organize WDC conference. When they‚Äôre not shouting about design systems and designops, they are busy raising their 11 year old son, shouting in a queer punk band or telling the world why Josie and the Pussycats is a criminally underrated film.\n\nCONVERGE 2024\nAt Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems‚Äîinspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/zeroheight/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "description": "Engines of Expression: Extending Design Systems With Editorial Flair\n\nModern design systems for the web and mobile applications have become very good at supporting their content‚Äîbut that content is usually very narrowly focused and singular of purpose. Their typographic systems are optimized in a similar way: to support the presentation of any content in a consistent and easily understood manner.\n\nBut accommodating anything means optimizing nothing‚Äîleaving us with endless sameness across the digital landscape. Since the modern web is driven by dynamic content systems, we can embrace modern techniques in CSS (the style language for the web) and technologies like variable fonts to build greater flexibility into those content systems, enabling us to support any content while still customizing the typesetting for individual articles or pages.\n\nWe‚Äôll look at examples showcasing how we can typeset headlines that scale with the screen, design promotional elements with flair, and even set variable axes for specific passages or headlines right in the browser during the content publishing process.\n\nGreat editorial design truly can make the leap from printed page to pixel screens‚Äîit just takes a great typeface, a good eye, and a little technical finesse.",

    "title": "Understanding the Impact of Well-Built Design Systems with Ben Callahan  - S4, Ep. 8",
    "description": "In this episode, we are joined by Ben Callahan, founder of Sparkbox and a leading figure in UX strategy with over 13 years of experience. Ben's expertise in creating impactful user experiences and fostering collaboration has earned him great respect in the design community. As a speaker, author, and design system coach, he continues to drive industry innovation. \n\nDiscussion Points : \n\n~ Can you walk us through your career journey and share some insights? 1:29\n~ How do you go about educating others on the benefits of a design system? 5:05\n~ How do you recommend implementing a design system? Is an independent code base, a Figma file, or a tool that hosts the design system the best approach? 8:11\n~ Rapid fire round 13:58\n~ Can you share your journey from your early experiences and childhood to your current role at Sparkbox, and how these experiences have shaped your career? 18:09\n~ How do you convince engineering teams to invest in design systems, given that many see it as just a design responsibility? 24:29\n\nShow notes\n\n~ I quickly fell in love with design and user experience. I kind of left that role and jumped out on my own to explore that opportunity a little bit more.\n~ We spend a lot of time with them thinking about education, helping everybody inside the organization understand what a system is, why it's important, and what it means for them.\n~ We've done some interesting studies to show, just from an efficiency standpoint, how much of an impact a system can have when it's built well and is being used. The numbers are quite staggering.\n~ I think of design systems not as a product, but as a program that has to exist inside an organization. When they're done well, they really become the way we build digital interfaces.\n~ Two-thirds of the effort is in writing really good documentation and training people to understand that's where they go to get the answers they need.\n~ I've got so many insights from people who are out there in the trenches doing this work on a daily basis. If you have questions or ideas on how this work can be done, or if you just need a community of people who can help support you through difficult times, that's really what this is becoming.\n\nLinks:\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bencallahan/ \nCompany‚Äôs Website: https://sparkbox.com/\nPersonal Website: https://bencallahan.com/\nThe Question: https://bencallahan.com/the-question -",

However, in order to provide long-term success for the entire product ecosystem, systems designers and developers must ensure contributions and collaborative outcomes can scale appropriately within the constraints of each brand, and the flexibility to support primary use cases for all teams. Without a strong opinionated team, contributions can become a Trojan horse for your design system; introducing unscalable methods and fragmenting the system to a point where it breaks down.¬†\n\nFeaturing: Nate Baldwin, Senior Staff Designer, Adobe",

What tools, artefacts, practices and processes do you need to keep shipping consistent user experience? What challenges await the organisations introducing design systems for the first time? Here is a story of how good engineering practices changed the way products are designed and built at Homegate.\n\n=====\nAbout Olga Skurativska\nüîó https://twitter.com/@_olko\nüîó https://friday-frontend-buffet.com\n\nAs a Principal Frontend Engineer at Homegate, Olga works with multiple teams helping them develop impressive skillsets and deliver killer products. Front end or back end, accessibility or performance, testing or writing quality code - she insists on doing it all and doing it well.\n\nA firm believer in sharing knowledge she helps drive Web Zurich and Vue Zurich communities, occasionally creates training materials and collects delicious crumbs of web development wisdom for her Friday Frontend Buffet project.\n\nCurrently on a mission to prove that great products and great developer experience are not mutually exclusive.\n\n=====\nAbout Front Conference Zurich: Where design meets technology.\n\nüîó https://twitter.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.instagram.com/frontzurich/\nüîó https://www.facebook.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontzurich/\nüîó https://mastodon.social/@front\nüîó https://www.tiktok.com/@frontzurich\n\nDesigners and developers share a common mission - to create amazing experiences. But it's not always easy for these two tribes to communicate. To bridge the gap between design and technology, we created the Front Conference in 2011.\n\nTo create great digital products, we rely on each other: designers on developers and developers on designers. That's why we came up with the idea of a conference for everyone involved in the design and implementation of a front end.\n\nBy staying at the forefront of both design and technology, we've grown to become the largest web conference in Switzerland. Our interests have broadened to reflect the increasing maturity of the industry. We now cover management topics such as design leadership, tech governance and UX strategy.\n\nOur attendees range from juniors to managers, and we attract key speakers to come to Zurich and share their knowledge in talks and workshops. \n\nThe conference has become a place to learn and network, and we have many loyal professionals who come back every year.",

Why is deciding on the name of a component more challenging than naming your child? Geri and Amy give names a roll call.\n\nGeri and Amy go back to school to put tokens under the microscope.\n\nIn this series, Amy and Geri put aside their vocal and opinionated assumptions to dive deep on design systems topics; from Figma libraries to design tokens to deciding if AI can really write decent documentation. Climb aboard the school bus for a field trip on the history, the conversations and the foundations that really make a design system great.\n\nAmy Hupe: https://twitter.com/amy_hupe\nGeri Reid: https://twitter.com/gerireid\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/zeroheight/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "description": "Creating effective design systems is a challenge, and making them accessible adds another layer of complexity. In this talk, we will explore the obstacles and opportunities of building inclusive design systems that thrive. Drawing on our experience creating the Chameleon Design System at GoTo, we will examine the typical stages companies go through when embracing inclusive design and share examples of past failures and lessons learned. By the end of the talk, attendees will have gained insights into how to avoid common pitfalls and create successful, accessible design systems that prioritize empathy and passion over perfectionism. \n\nJoin Wendy on this journey towards more inclusive and effective design! \n\n____________\n\nABOUT THE SPEAKER\n\nDriven by a strong interest in communication and human connection, Wendy holds a PhD in Applied Linguistics and is a certified Communication Designer (Diplom). As she enjoys sharing her experience and knowledge, she has given a variety of talks and workshops on accessibility, design, eye-tracking research, and creative subtitling. When she isn‚Äôt pushing for user-centered design and systematic problem-solving, she can usually be found climbing at boulder gyms or all across Europe‚Äôs beautiful mountain ranges.  \n\n____________\n\nMore about Europe's friendliest conference for UX Research & Design: uxcon.io",

    "description": "üá®üá≠ #FRONTZURICH üîó https://frontconference.com/tickets\nüéüÔ∏è Secure your place and join us in person or online.\n\nüë©üèª‚Äçüíª Designing a Design System\nProduct Design for web and mobile is evolving at a fast pace. As the range of devices and platforms continues to expand, so do the various design considerations. Design systems help a design team build a framework that meets their needs by bringing together all of the critical design components - including style guides, pattern and UI libraries, CSS frameworks and other resources. In this session, Jina, a Lead Designer on the Design Systems team at Salesforce UX, will share: - Strategies for how to approach, design and build an effective design system - How to successfully maintain the system to ensure ongoing usefulness - Elements that design systems need to be sustainable that are critical for success\n\n=====\nAbout Jina Anne\nüîó https://twitter.com/@jina\nüîó http://jina.me/\n\nJina is Lead Designer on the Design Systems team at Salesforce UX, where she helps create systems for enterprise software. She also loves Sass; she designs and maintains the Sass website, she organizes the San Francisco Sass & Frontend Meet Up, The Mixin, and she curates Sass News. She coauthored two books, Fancy Form Design and The Art & Science of CSS. Previously, she has worked with rad companies including Apple, GitHub, Engine Yard, and Crush + Lovely.\n\n=====\nAbout Front Conference Zurich: Where design meets technology.\n\nüîó https://twitter.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.instagram.com/frontzurich/\nüîó https://www.facebook.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontzurich/\nüîó https://mastodon.social/@front\nüîó https://www.tiktok.com/@frontzurich\n\nDesigners and developers share a common mission - to create amazing experiences. But it's not always easy for these two tribes to communicate. To bridge the gap between design and technology, we created the Front Conference in 2011.\n\nTo create great digital products, we rely on each other: designers on developers and developers on designers. That's why we came up with the idea of a conference for everyone involved in the design and implementation of a front end.\n\nBy staying at the forefront of both design and technology, we've grown to become the largest web conference in Switzerland. Our interests have broadened to reflect the increasing maturity of the industry. We now cover management topics such as design leadership, tech governance and UX strategy.\n\nOur attendees range from juniors to managers, and we attract key speakers to come to Zurich and share their knowledge in talks and workshops. \n\nThe conference has become a place to learn and network, and we have many loyal professionals who come back every year.",

The world first uninterrupted FPV one shot was captured by a manually piloted custom built drone, designed specifically for the challenge of keeping up with the car at speeds of over 300kph.\n\nIt took Red Bull and the Dutch Drone Gods over a year to create a drone that can accelerate two times faster than an F1 car, reaching 300 km/h in just 4 seconds with a top speed of over 350 km/h. The development was accelerated by access to know-how and processes of Red Bull Advanced Technologies, a high-performance engineering arm of Oracle Red Bull Racing Formula 1 team and trialled behind the RB8 and RB19 cars driven by @liamlawson30  and David Coulthard. \n\n\n #redbull #GivesYouWiiings #f1 \n_________________________________________________\nExperience the world of Red Bull like you have never seen it before with the best action sports clips on the web, original series and livestreams.\n\nGet the FREE Red Bull TV apps for all your devices: http://win.gs/RedBullTVApps  \nSubscribe to Red Bull on Youtube: http://win.gs/SubToRedBull\nCheck out Red Bull on TikTok: https://win.gs/TikTok\nRed Bull on Facebook: http://win.gs/redbullfb\nRed Bull on Instagram: http://win.gs/RedBullInstagram\nRed Bull on Twitter: http://win.gs/redbulltwitter",

It may be time for you to look at your design system from a different perspective.\n\nIn this session, Ben Callahan will show you how design systems and company culture are inextricably linked. We'll examine how a deeper understanding of each is necessary to get you where you want to go, including:\n\nAn exploration of four types of organizational culture\nAn understanding of design systems as a bonafide subculture within an organization\nA discussion of how misalignment between design system culture and organizational culture can create major problems\nAn explanation of the two most dominant design system subcultures‚Äîcollaborative and controlling and how each‚Äîwhile viable‚Äîpresents its own unique challenges\nIn this session you will learn the importance of cultural alignment so that you can achieve the goals for your design system faster. You will also be able to avoid past pitfalls thanks to a greater recognition of your newfound understanding of the importance culture plays in a systematic design practice.",

    "description": "As design system maintainers, we want to make sure that our primitive variables are created but never surfaced in the properties panel.\n\nTo do this, we can firstly descope them, and secondly make sure they are not selected for publishing.\n\nThis works if your primitive and semantic variables exist within the same file. If they don't, make sure you publish them! Otherwise, you will not be able to use them as aliases within your semantic variables.\n____________________________________________________\n\nFigma is free to use.

    "description": "üá®üá≠ FRONT CONFERENCE ZURICH üîó https://frontconference.com/tickets\nüéüÔ∏è Secure your place at this year's conference and join us in person or online.\n\nDesign systems are great for scaling design across complex organisations and products. But in our drive for scale, consistency and standards, have we considered the risks and the cost? What are the problems we may face and how can we overcome them? In this talk, Mark will expose the ugly truth of rolling out design systems; from engineering and code, to designers and stakeholders and provide guidance from his experience of producing design systems for over a decade.\n\nAbout Mark Boulton\nüîó https://twitter.com/markboulton\n\nMark leads digital communications at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) where he‚Äôs building delivery teams, developing a design system for Life Sciences, and trying to figure out how to scale design in a scientific environment where the bottom line is discovery not dollars.\n\nPrior to working at EMBL, Mark was Design Director at Monotype where he led scaling of a new design system across the company‚Äôs portfolio of products. Previously, Mark ran a design studio and worked on design systems for CERN, Al Jazeera, and ESPN.\n\nMark lives in Wales with his wife, two daughters and a dog that thinks it‚Äôs a bear.\n\n=====\nAbout Front Conference Zurich: Where design meets technology.\n\nüîó https://twitter.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.instagram.com/frontzurich/\nüîó https://www.facebook.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontzurich/\n\nDesigners and developers share a common mission - to create amazing experiences. But it's not always easy for these two tribes to communicate. To bridge the gap between design and technology, we created the Front Conference in 2011.\n\nTo create great digital products, we rely on each other: designers on developers and developers on designers. That's why we came up with the idea of a conference for everyone involved in the design and implementation of a front end.\n\nBy staying at the forefront of both design and technology, we've grown to become the largest web conference in Switzerland. Our interests have broadened to reflect the increasing maturity of the industry. We now cover management topics such as design leadership, tech governance and UX strategy.\n\nOur attendees range from juniors to managers, and we attract key speakers to come to Zurich and share their knowledge in talks and workshops. \n\nThe conference has become a place to learn and network, and we have many loyal professionals who come back every year.",

It‚Äôs no wonder that, once we put a name on this snowball (hello, ‚Äúdesign systems‚Äù), it only picked up speed. If you manage more than one site, if you support more than one brand, if you want to be more efficient or more consistent or more unified in your digital interface building approach‚Äîthis is the session for you.\n\nWe‚Äôll start with a breakdown of design system concepts, reframing how to think about them in a practical and approachable way (The Anatomy of a Design System).\n- Where design systems live in an organization\n- The four layers of a design system (concepts)\n- The three parts of each layer (tangibles)\n\nThen we‚Äôll dig into the four major concepts covered by the Design System Maturity Model developed from years of work, interviews, and industry-wide surveys.\n\n- The stages of design system maturity\n- How a design system‚Äôs origin story impacts its path through maturity\n- A framework for maturing in a healthy way\n- A framework for maintaining stability\n\nJoin for this info-packed half-hour session!",

    "description": "üá®üá≠ #FRONTZURICH üîó https://frontconference.com/tickets\nüéüÔ∏è Secure your place and join us in person or online.\n\nüë©üèª‚Äçüíª Architecting CSS grid in a design system\nCSS grid has been supported by major browsers since 2017 and based on the State of CSS survey, it is a fairly well known CSS property. In this talk, I'd like to share the thought process and exploration of how CSS grid can be used in a design system meant to be used by a wide audience.\n\n=====\nAbout Chen Hui Jing @huijing \nüîó https://twitter.com/@hj_chen\nüîó https://chenhuijing.com\n\nMy name is Chen Hui Jing. I first dipped my toe into the waters of web development when I built my first HTML website in 2008 for the Malaysia Basketball Association.\n\nFrom there, I discovered the existence of content management systems and migrated the site over to Drupal. I stopped working on the site a year later and put my web development journey on hold (the original site no longer exists either).\n\nAfter a 4-year sabbatical (from web development), I decided to restart this journey by diving in head-first this time. In September 2013, I got a job in the web industry and this website chronicles my experiences as I learn new things, fail spectacularly and make cool stuff along the way.\n\nI also founded Talk.CSS, a meetup around all things CSS, with Chris Lienert, and ran it with my best mate, Gao Wei after Chris returned to Australia.\n\nThe idea for Talk.CSS was born on the Kopi.JS slack channel on October 26, 2015 and within 2 hours, we had a logo, a Gitter channel, a Meetup.com account, a venue for the meetup and a couple speakers. Colour us efficient.\n\nI also have a day job as a Frontend Developer at Shopify, because we all need to pay the bills.\n\n=====\nAbout Front Conference Zurich: Where design meets technology.\n\nüîó https://twitter.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.instagram.com/frontzurich/\nüîó https://www.facebook.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontzurich/\nüîó https://mastodon.social/@front\n\nDesigners and developers share a common mission - to create amazing experiences. But it's not always easy for these two tribes to communicate. To bridge the gap between design and technology, we created the Front Conference in 2011.\n\nTo create great digital products, we rely on each other: designers on developers and developers on designers. That's why we came up with the idea of a conference for everyone involved in the design and implementation of a front end.\n\nBy staying at the forefront of both design and technology, we've grown to become the largest web conference in Switzerland. Our interests have broadened to reflect the increasing maturity of the industry. We now cover management topics such as design leadership, tech governance and UX strategy.\n\nOur attendees range from juniors to managers, and we attract key speakers to come to Zurich and share their knowledge in talks and workshops. \n\nThe conference has become a place to learn and network, and we have many loyal professionals who come back every year.",

This presentation will help you face that challenge head-on and shape your approach, making things more likely to succeed.\n\nPresented by Ben Callahan at Clarity 2022, on November 11th, 2022.

    "description": "Figma is free to use. Sign up here: https://bit.ly/3msp0OV\n\nBy definition, a variable is something that can vary in value or take on multiple values. Variables in Figma store reusable values, like color values and numbers, that can be applied to all kinds of design properties and even prototypes! A variable‚Äôs values can also reference other variables, making updating design systems a breeze. In this video, we‚Äôll cover how variables work, and how to use them to represent design tokens and account for different modes and themes.\n\n* Update: When following along with the tutorial at 10:30,  the variable called \".5\" will no longer work.  This is due to our alignment with the W3C spec which doesn't allow periods in names.  Calling the variable \"spacing/half\" will work, instead.\nWe are doing a follow-up in the next coming months where we‚Äôll be separating out the ‚Äúfigma name‚Äù from the code syntax, which may let us loosen these restrictions.

    "description": "Double feature\n\nA practical guide to building accessible forms on the web\nSpeaker: Kateryna Porshnieva ‚Äì Front-End Engineer, Independent\n\nWeb forms are crucial for user interactions on the web, and to ensure our products provide an inclusive experience for all, we need to build them with accessibility in mind. In this talk, we'll dive into best practices and practical tips for crafting web forms that are accessible and won't leave anyone behind. We'll start by focusing on why accessibility is important, followed by a quick tour of the latest WCAG, HTML, and ARIA standards. Next, we'll delve into the principles of inclusive design and how assistive technology interacts with forms. We'll then discuss common patterns in forms and how to implement them inclusively, along with strategies for managing focus state, navigation and validation ‚Äì all supported by practical examples in React.\n\nMake it accessible and inclusive, make it great!\nSpeakers: \nVanessa Guilloteau ‚Äì Head of Product Design, CANAL+ Group\nNahema Soussi ‚Äì Product Designer & Accessibility Specialist, CANAL+ Group\n\nAccessibility and inclusivity have become key societal issues around the world in the last few years. Social networks and large international groups like GAFAM know how to reach large audiences by offering increasingly inclusive and innovative services. What about other major digital players who do not have the same means but are still convinced that accessibility and inclusivity have become essential? At CANAL+, accessibility has become a pillar of the company's strategy for the next few years, especially for myCANAL, our Live and VOD platform. Because it is available on many devices (mobile, tablet, desktop, TV, video game console) and across various platforms (web, iOS, Android), making myCANAL compatible with all forms of disabilities, and more particularly visual disabilities, remains an incredible challenge we try to meet every day. We would like to share a few initiatives we have worked on over the last 2 years to make video-watching accessible to as many people as possible.\n\nPlease visit https://config.figma.com/video-on-demand/6329864440112 to view ASL version of this Config 2023 session\n\nFigma is free to use.

Inviting insights and improvements from a design system's community of users is what makes it reliable and representative. So why do so many of us find it so hard to achieve and sustain? Are we going about it all wrong, or is there something more insidious at play here?

Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! \n\nIn this talk, Imran Afzal talks about reflective practice. \n\nWhatever role we play, it‚Äôs critical that we stay relevant. Continuous learning is a must. There‚Äôs very little allowance for our approach or knowledge to stagnate in UX. However, we all lead busy lives in a fast-paced society. Rarely is there a moment to stop and think. If we‚Äôre not jumping from one product release to another, we‚Äôre feeling the pressure of delivering high-quality work, quickly. This can harm our long-term success and impact.\n\nHowever, reflective practice can help. By taking time out to think about our actions, we can learn from our experiences and use that knowledge to evolve our mindset. Imran discusses what it means to reflect on our experiences and the impact of that process on our future. The talk explores the benefits of taking time to reflect, while also providing guidance on introducing reflective practice into your work.\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! \n\nWatch Lily Dart discuss the culture and good and bad aspects of design systems. \n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in design systems, you‚Äôve no doubt dreamt of the kind of design system you‚Äôd like to build. Perhaps you know precisely what tooling you‚Äôd use or how you‚Äôd structure the components. A design system that is elegant, easy to use, and produces beautiful results. But if you‚Äôve tried creating a design system, you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll achieve your original aspirations. Arguments over standards, complexity in tooling and abuses, and mis-uses of the libraries are all common pitfalls for new systems. \n\nSo why is it so hard to build a great design system? A successful system is more than UI and code. What underpins every system - good or bad -  is culture. And without the right culture, your beautiful design system will fail. Based on her experience running the first-ever design systems team at Lloyds Banking Group, Lily will be talking about the relationship between design systems and organizational culture. How to identify yours, when to design for it, and when to fight against it.\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "description": "‚ö†Ô∏è We apologize - the recording had technical issues. Some of Sarrah's audio is missing and some of it isn't coming from the main mic. \nConverge is zeroheight‚Äôs one-day design systems conference. On May 18, 2023, we hosted Converge US in San Francisco at the Great Star Theater! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.\n\nSarrah is the Director of Design at [Honeycomb.io](http://honeycomb.io/) and based out of Zephyrhills, Florida.\n\nLast year, Sarrah talked at Hatch Conf about how their design system, Lattice, had stalled and was essentially dead in the water. Through some tough conversations, She realized that as a leader, she needed to prioritize it. No more working on it in spurts and keeping things moving at a snail's pace.\n\nFast forward to quarter one of this year. They had secured a dedicated spot on the roadmap for Lattice with a PM, Engineering, and Design dedicated to the effort. They had one quarter to make as much headway as possible in evolving our design system into something the whole company could use. That meant considering the elephant in the room ‚Äì there was no design systems team to pick up the effort after this quarter. How could they ensure they would end up in a different place than before? What could they do in that time to get other teams to adopt and use Lattice in their day-to-day development? Most importantly, who would own the process of adding and developing components once the effort was \"over\"?\n\nIn this talk, Sarrah will go into how they approached it from three distinct perspectives: The design Director (getting support and buy-in), The Designer (coordinating with PM, Eng, and the design team to plan and execute), and The Engineer (coordinating with PM, Design, and working on component migration and development).\n\nSarrah Vesselov: https://twitter.com/SVesselov\nConference host: Michelle Chin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin/\nAbout Converge US: https://zeroheight.com/converge-us\n\nFind out more about zeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero-height/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "description": "A design system is often an expression (for better or worse) of the values of the people that build it. This is why design systems flounder‚Äîthey are often launched as a bridge between teams without an understanding of the various subcultures of those teams. When companies align their design system with and make them work for their existing company culture, the goals for that system are more easily realized.\n\nIf you feel like you‚Äôre swimming upstream with your design system, it could be the result of a cultural problem‚Äînot a technical one. It‚Äôs time for you to look at your design system from a different angle.\n\nIn this virtual learning event, Ben Callahan will show you how design systems and company culture are inextricably linked and how a deeper understanding of each is necessary to get you where you want to go.\n\n00:00 A Quick Story\n04:11 A Framework for Organizational Culture\n08:52 A Framework for Competing Values\n18:18 The Healthy or Unhealthy Design System Subculture\n32:01 Cultural Compatibilities\n38:27 Can a Design System Subculture Change Organizational Culture?",

    "description": "Accessibility is about ensuring people can perceive and operate digital interfaces. For sighted people, this can be a difficult problem to solve. There are a plethora of visual experiences and impairments, and solving for one person‚Äôs challenge may adversely affect another‚Äôs. In other cases, a solution may not actually help the people it is intended to help. For example, dark mode may seem reasonable for photophobia (light sensitive people). However, high contrast text in dark mode can result in optical glare, making text illegible. The way that we can solve for the complexities of individual visual experience is with color personalization. \n\nIn this talk, Nate will discuss the basics of the human visual system, color science, and how they relate to user interfaces. He will use examples from his work creating Adobe Spectrum‚Äôs color system in conjunction with their open source color tool, Leonardo.",

The JSON object should have the following structure:\n\n1. A \"typography\" object containing \"headline\", \"intro\", \"body\", and \"caption\" categories.\n2. Headline category should include H1 to H5.\n3. Font sizes should range from 80px to 12px, with the largest size being 80px and the smallest 12px.\n4. The fontWeight \"normal\" should be named \"Regular\".\n5. Font size and line height tokens should use size names XS to XXL.\n6. Font family, font size, line height, and font weight tokens should be separate hierarchy points, referenced in the \"typography\" object as properties.\n7. Use singular naming for all tokens.\n8. Define font weight values as \"Regular\" and \"Bold\" instead of numeric values.\n9. Provide line height values in pixels.\n10. Use property names like \"{fontSizes.xxl}\" to define all properties of the font styles.\n11. Use Montserrat for the font family\n12. Define a \"type\" for all arrays like here:\n\"xl\": {\n      \"value\": \"64px\",\n      \"type\": \"fontSizes\"\n    }\n13. The JSON structure should resemble the following example for H1:\n\n{\n\"H1\": {\n        \"value\": {\n          \"fontFamily\": \"{fontFamilies.sansSerif}\",\n          \"fontWeight\": \"{fontWeights.bold}\",\n          \"fontSize\": \"{fontSizes.xxl}\",\n          \"lineHeight\": \"{lineHeights.xxl}\"\n        }\n}\n}\n\nEnsure that the JSON object provided always matches this structure and token hierarchy.",

The governance flow is simple but can be customized to fit your team's needs. \n\nBilly unpacks the categories with examples and shows you how to adjust as you work through the template.\n\nWith this template, you can educate new team members on building their individual processes and understand how to contribute to the design system.

    "description": "Content Strategy Seattle Meetup recording of March 15, 2023 event\n\nDesign systems offer content creators, designers, marketers, and other enterprise content owners ways to control the interaction and look and feel of elements‚Äîand gain consistency in exchange for some creative control. Good for the content, and good for the people who need to approve the content, right? By including content strategy, design systems become more comprehensive, taking an experience from good to great. But we need to change how we collaborate to make that process successful‚Äîand sustainable. Come learn how we can shift the conversation and address publishing culture throughout the process to ensure successful rollout, adoption, and ongoing use.\n\nAbout Our Speakers\nMargot Bloomstein is the principal of Appropriate, Inc., a brand and content strategy consultancy, and a partner in Loupe Collective. She is the author of Trustworthy: How the Smartest Brands Beat Cynicism and Bridge the Trust Gap and the industry mainstay Content Strategy at Work. Over the past 20 years, she has led content strategy efforts for the American Montessori Society, American Veterinary Medical Association, Harvard University, Lindt and Spr√ºngli, Lovehoney, Mailchimp, Peterson‚Äôs, Sallie Mae, and Timberland. She developed the popular message architecture-driven approach to content strategy and created BrandSort, a tool embraced by brands to clarify their communication goals. Margot teaches in the content strategy graduate program at FH Joanneum University in Austria and speaks around the world about brand-driven content strategy and designing for trust.\n\nGreg Storey is a partner in Loupe Collective, where he brings a wealth of experience and wisdom to his work as a founder, adviser, and leader gained through 25 years of experience in the industry. His work with agencies, medium-sized companies, and enterprise organizations like IBM, USAA, InVision, Stanford University, Sundance Film Festival, AMC Theatres, and BBVA Compass has given him a unique and valuable perspective on what makes design successful in a variety of conditions. He's a willing collaborator ready to partner across teams and loves to break down silos and build people and teams. Greg is known for bringing unique perspectives to problems that help get teams unstuck.",

    "title": "Amplify Webinar: Women in Tech Wikipedia Edit-a-thon",
    "description": "For International Women‚Äôs Day, the theme is #EmbraceEquity, which inspired us to host an edit-a-thon this month. In this recording, our Design Advocate Michelle walks you through the basics of editing Wikipedia, identifies great places for beginners to edit, and provides a list of pages that could be improved or created. \n\nWe decided to host this because there‚Äôs a huge gender gap on Wikipedia. In less than 19% of biographies on Wikipedia are about women. Wikipedia is a data source on many things we rely on - from Google‚Äôs knowledge panels to what teaches AI systems. When women aren‚Äôt represented in Wikipedia, we‚Äôre omitted from people‚Äôs knowledge and discussion, and our accomplishments go unknown.\n\nThis will be an ongoing project for her and some friends. So if you missed the webinar, you can catch up on this recording and join in a future edit-a-thon session. \n\nEditing Wikipedia is more user-friendly now, making creating and editing pages even easier. By embracing this learning curve, we can work toward better equity and representation of women in Wikipedia and beyond.\n\nLink to slides: https://bit.ly/amp-wit-slides\n\nLink to wiki project page: https://bit.ly/amp-wit-wiki\n\nReach out to Michelle on Twitter: https://twitter.com/soysaucechin\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "title": "Integrating Design and Code (DSCC Toronto)",
    "description": "Design Systems Community Chapter (DSCC) Toronto is bringing to you a couple of talks that involve Integrating Design and Code.\r\n\r\nWe have two special guests who will present a talk each about their experiences surrounding this topic.\r\n\r\nThis event is sponsored by Rangle.io.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n\r\n0:49 - Design Systems Community, Housekeeping, and a word from our sponsor\r\n8:28 - Talk 1: Why You Should Use Tokens and Tokens Studio by Brandon Surya\n24:00 - Q&A With Brandon\r\n31:28 - Talk 2: Code is for designers, too by Mateo Morris\n56:08 - Q&A with Mateo and Courtney\r\n1:01:37 - Closing remarks\r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn:\r\n\r\n- How to effectively organize and manage design tokens.\r\n- Considerations for how to enable designs and content managers to integrate with coded results.\r\n\r\nMeet our guests:\r\n\r\nBrandon Surya\r\n\r\nBrandon Surya is a senior product designer at Rangle.io, a modern digital products and platforms consultancy that specializes in building design systems. He‚Äôs currently leading the use and understanding of design tokens within Rangle‚Äôs design team and how it can close the gap between designers and engineers. He believes that design tokenization is a powerful methodology that can help scale design systems and solve a lot of company‚Äôs pain points. In his spare time, he also likes to rock climb, take photos, game, and obsess over niche hobbies.\r\n\r\nTalk: Why You Should Use Tokens and Tokens Studio\r\n\r\nYou‚Äôre using tokens and you don‚Äôt even know it! One of the goals of a design system is to close the gap between multiple disciplines and especially between design and development. With the features and tools Figma provides us, this gap becomes smaller. But what if I tell you with the proper integration of design tokens, we can make this gap closer than it was ever before. Sounds great right? Let‚Äôs talk about tokens and how it can level up your design system!\r\n\r\nMateo Morris; @_mateomorris\r\n\r\nMateo is the creator of Primo - a new kind of open-source CMS that aims to put code within reach of everyone and anyone (omit). He‚Äôs worked as a freelancer, agency developer, and startup founder. Together with his wife Courtney, he started and taught a coding course for refugees in Cairo, Egypt called Cairo Codes which they ran until the beginning of Covid. In his free time he enjoys writing music, cooking, and hanging out with Courtney.\r\n\r\nTalk: Code is for designers, too\r\n\r\nOne of the largest pain points designers face in translating their designs into code is having to go through developers. No-code tools let designers circumnavigate developers, but usually come with the downsides of being generic, restrictive, and unscalable. So what does it look like when code becomes more approachable and designers can access it themselves?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAbout Design Systems Community\r\n\r\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems. No matter how you engage with design systems, we all play a role in making information accessible for everyone, and without barriers.\r\n\r\nHow can I contribute?\r\n\r\nInterested to host, sponsor, or speak at our meetups, email us toronto@designsystems.community\r\n\r\nFollow us on our social channels\r\n\r\nhttps://designsystems.community/\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Meetup\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Twitter\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Instagram\r\n\r\nBy participating in DSC events, you agree to our code of conduct: https://designsystems.community/conduct/",

    "description": "This event took place on October 12, 2022 on Twitter Spaces. It's an open discussion about applied design tokens.\n\nMeet our guests:\n\nEsther Cheran; @EstherCheran\nEsther is one of the Co-founders at Hyma, best known for the Figma Tokens plugin. In 2020 she first coined the term Headless Design System while trying to solve a complex multi-brand design system, which became popular after her talk at `Figma - In the file`. The concept of a Headless Design System using design tokens has since become a widely adopted approach for building multi-brand/theme design systems. When she‚Äôs not obsessing about Design Tokens, you likely find her reading a book, sketching or painting.\n\nMike Kamminga; @mikekamminga\nMike has been a Creative Technologist since 1999, living on the edge of design and technology. Currently he's Imagining and building the future of Design Tokens as the CEO at Hyma, the company best known for Figma Tokens. He also pioneered the headless design system concept together with Esther Cheran, which fundamentally changed the way multi-brand design systems are built today.\n\nJames Nash; @c1rrus\nDesign system aficionado, classically trained webmaster, slayer of pixels, DTCG spec editor and occasional fashion terrorist.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems. No matter how you engage with design systems, we all play a role in making information accessible for everyone, and without barriers.\n\nHow can I contribute?\nInterested to host, sponsor, or speak at our meetups, email us toronto@designsystems.community\n\nFollow us on our social channels\nhttps://designsystems.community/\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Meetup\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Twitter\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Instagram",

    "description": "This talk was recorded at Craft Conference 2022. Adekunle Oduye from Plaid company spoke about design system and product design. Building a design system that scales is hard. You have to get stakeholder buy-in and then establish a style guide and then build out a UI components library and then develop a voice and tone that captures the brand and and and... There‚Äôs so much to do! That can fuel envy when we look at popular design systems on the web and say, ‚ÄúWe want to have something like that.‚Äù But how do we get there? What are the specific steps we can take to build a successful design system? A world-class design system will not only allow teams to build scalable products today, but also lay the foundation for future innovations. Done right, it will provide engineers with production ready UI components and enable designers to craft front-end prototypes. Learn about the three Ps and how it can help you achieve these goals. In this talk, audience will learn: - How to identify and prioritize the users of your design system - The process of building a design system from the ground up - How to setup a design system to serve multiple use cases\n\nThe event was organized by Crafthub.\n\nYou can watch the rest of the conference talks on our channel.\n\nIf you are interested in more speakers, tickets and details of the conference, check out our website: https://craft-conf.com/\nIf you are interested in more events from our company: https://crafthub.events/",

But it's one thing to come up with a design system for a website, and another to translate it for the people who manage the content that goes into your carefully crafted design system. They say software is eating the world, but I would venture to say that even more people are involved in the care and maintenance of websites, and it's important that they're remembered as the standards rise ever higher.\n\nLet's explore some strategies for translating parts of a design system for editorial needs - the functional spec, if you will - and take a look at some real-world examples of how powerful that can be in a visual editing experience in a popular CMS.\n\nPresented by Helen Hou-Sandi at Clarity 2021, on October 27th, 2021.

There are tools, books, blog posts, and talks all built around trying to bridge this gap, but what if the key to creating more cohesive and inclusive teams is really the people within those teams? Instead of bridging a gap, what if we eliminate it altogether with a group of people called Design Technologists. They‚Äôre typically familiar with design and research best practices, yet also talented at creating accessible, scalable components with APIs that engineering teams can easily understand and utilize. They understand the language of both worlds already, so why not lean into this role and mindset when creating design systems with a shared language. \n\nLet‚Äôs discuss what exactly Design Technology entails, how this role creates stronger teams and tighter connections across an organization, and how everyone can think like a Design Technologist, regardless of their title.\n\nPresented by Ayesha Mazrana at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021.

    "description": "Building design systems is a thankless job. It feels like some days the quality of the product's UI is weighing on your shoulders and others like you're being critiqued for stifling the design team's creativity. When you build an internal product for your peers, critical feedback becomes personal and can demotivate or derail your team. It can feel like sprints and quarters are spent reacting to the needs of others, and your roadmap is commanded by the teams you support. Acting in a support role means you're responsible for defining your team's motivation, milestones, success... and how your work impacts the business overall. \n\nWriting this talk began as a way to cope with burnout after 4 years of working on design systems. Intended as a cathartic moment of self-reflection, this talk will pull from personal experiences [in hope of] providing practical strategies that break the cycles of fatigue, stress, and overwhelm; empowering design systems leaders to define their focus and what really matters.\n\nPresented by Lauren LoPrete at Clarity 2021, on October 27th, 2021.

Better still, the more ambient nature of devices like speakers or displays create the possibility for better digital wellbeing and point towards what a post-mobile future might look like.\n\nYet most of our design systems only focus on phones and computers.\n\nLet‚Äôs explore how cross-device hardware trends and use cases can help drive our design systems towards a truly responsive and inclusive future.\n\nPresented by Jen Cotton at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021.

    "description": "Some brands have very loyal customers due to their product‚Äôs being reliable and having a high quality level. This is the same when constructing design system components that designers and engineers use everyday when building features. You not only need to make sure they‚Äôre functional and align to the product's aesthetics, but they also have to be performant, accessible and scalable. Having buggy components will decrease confidence for the design system.\n\nOne way to minimize bugs in components is to use a BDD approach. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a programming style where tests are created from the user‚Äôs perspective before code is written. But what are the most effective ways to implement BDD when building components? How can BDD be beneficial to developers and also designers, researchers and QA?\n\nThe audience will learn:\n- The benefits of BDD and TDD\n- Techniques on how to implement BDD into a design system process\n- How to leverage automating testing while building components\n\nPresented by Adekunle Oduye at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021.

    "description": "Ever heard of Design Systems but don't know how to actually get started into the field or learn about it? If you are someone who wants to understand how it is like working on Design Systems and is a junior/entry level designer in the making, this group session is for you! On another note, everyone in the design community can join us!\n\nIn collaboration with DePaul User Experience Association(DUXA), a UX student org at DePaul University in Chicago, IL, this group session, \"Intro to Design Systems in the eyes of Design Professionals\", will be co-hosted by ADPList City Ambassadors, Maelanny Alcantara and Wendy Chuang.\n\nJoin us this Friday, April 15 at 7 pm CDT / 8 am SGT (Singapore Time) for this exciting topic with these Amazing Design Mentors, Bob Sampson, Matthew Talebi, Jennie S. Yip, and Derek Torsani! These Design System Professionals will share their professional tips and work experiences to learn what it's like working in this field. \n\nSee you there!\n\nHave any questions for the mentors? Ask away here by April 14:\n\nhttps://www.menti.com/w9sfmmfxiu\n\n_\n\nAbout the Speakers\n\nBob Sampson started in this industry in 2000 as a Junior Javascript Developer at his first tech company, growing into a Senior Designer by 2013. At Copperleaf as their first Senior Product Designer in 2016 transitioned to a newly created role as DesignOps Lead in 2018.\n\nAt Copperleaf drove the task to build a design system from scratch with a dedicated development team, and having it consumed by 12 designers, 100+ developers, and multiple products in a suite. The next step in his careers was starting a new challenge in 2022 at Tangerine Bank as its Design Systems Lead, working alongside a passionate (and growing) design team.\n\nAnd in 2021 was proud to join ADPList as one of their mentors, hoping to help other designers understands design systems, and talking about being non-neurotypical in your career.\n\nMatthew Talebi has worked across various companies in the Bay Area, including at places like Intuit and Apple, and for the past few years now working in Singapore. When it comes to design systems, Matthew has around five years of experience and has worked to see how we can seamlessly incorporate topics, like accessibility, into a design system.\n\nSome other topics also include growth for designers utilizing a design system, questions such as - how can we ensure our designer have the visual freedom and creativity when a design system has matured?\n\nMatthew also has a lot of front-end web development knowledge, working in hybrid roles in the past as well. This gives him the advantage of being able to communicate and keep designers and developers on the same page as much as possible when building products.\n\nJennie S. Yip is a hybrid design engineer with a heart for elegant user interfaces, simple user experiences, and beautifully crafted code. She specializes in building scalable design systems and leading multi-disciplinary teams. She collaborates seamlessly with designers and engineers, solving problems in an engineering mindset with a keen eye for design.\n\nWith over 17 years of experience, Jennie has worked as a designer and front-end developer for the majority of her career, for a spectrum of tech companies and industries across government, e-commerce, online education, and software. She is currently a Design Architect at Atlassian, crafting a vision and strategy for Atlassian Design System, whilst orchestrating her team through the complexity of design systems at an enterprise scale.\n\nWhen she is not organizing chaos, you can find her practicing yoga, propagating plants, or contributing to the design systems community in little ways, such as mentoring for ADPList and OOOHours.\n\nDerek Torsani is a designer currently tending to design systems at Plaid, He previously built design systems at Gusto, Oracle, and Alarm.com. After completing his undergraduate degree in Graphic Design at MICA (Maryland Institute College of Art), he went on to work in a variety of design practices, including motion, graphic, web, and product design, before entering the world of design systems full-time.\n\nDuring his mentorships, Derek enjoys learning just as much from his mentee as he teaches as a mentor. In addition to design, Derek is a musician, painter, and reader.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLearn more: http://adplist.org/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/adplist\nTwitter:Ôªø https://twitter.com/ADPList\n\n#adplist #design #uxdesign #mentorship #internship #productmanagement #ux #startups #careeradvice #growth #productresearch #designresearch. #research #growth #productdesign\n\nWelcome to the official ADPList YouTube channel.

    "description": "The Government Digital Service (GDS) talks‚Ä¶how to start a career in tech.\n\nAccording to a Tech Nation Talent report, young people could be wrongly counting themselves out of a fulfilling career because they‚Äôre worried about things like their skills background, where they came from or their lack of ‚Äúnetwork‚Äù. \n\nWe don‚Äôt want anyone to miss out on a great career in digital, data or technology. Because diverse teams that reflect the society they serve are more effective and better to be a part of (and those are the types of teams we‚Äôre trying to build).\n\nWe asked 3 of our developers to respond to the report‚Äôs findings, and hopefully put some of those myths and misconceptions to bed.\n\nRosa, Iqbal and Kelvin share their own experiences and talk about the different roles and disciplines you can work in. They also share practical tips and advice on how to get started in the tech community - whatever your background or starting point.\n\nEnjoyed the video and keen to pursue a career in technology; why not start your tech career at the Government Digital Service?

    "description": "About the talk:\nToday, nearly every company is trying to create or evolve their own design language system. Often, the goal is to enable designers to create consistently meaningful user experiences. Usually, decisions have already been made in the system before the designers commence working on them, leaving them to question their unique role in the world of design systems. \n\nWhen designers are not spending time rehashing colours and fonts, how can they anticipate and educate themselves in new skills and frameworks that will be required of them?\n\nIn this talk, you will take away best practices for creating and adopting a design language system, as well as key ideas for enabling your company to prepare its' designers for the future.\n\n00:56  The definition of 'design' today.\n01:20  Design is relationships.\n02:31  What is a design system?\n03:08  The Design System Hierarchy of Human Needs.\n05:18  Definition of Design Systems.\n07:00  Airbnb's product today.\n08:53  \"Why the system functions the way it does.\" Defining new parameters and new arguments by the designers: The first order of Design Systems.\n09:07  Journey Systems: The second order of Design Systems.\n10:18  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: The Use of Storyboards.\n10:39  Using Storyboarding as a way to understanding the customer experience at Airbnb.\n12:15  ‚ÄúWhen we make new services, maintaining journeys is critical for capturing the feeling of each moment in the human experience.‚Äù ‚ÄîHayley Hughes.

It‚Äôs just that we don‚Äôt think of it that way, because its ‚Äúpeople stuff‚Äù. So we avoid it. Because ‚Äúpeople stuff‚Äù is ‚Äúhard‚Äù.\n\nI‚Äôd like to convince you otherwise.

Not only that, I‚Äôll show how to do this using some of the core principles and techniques we already know, love, and use to build effective design systems.\n\nYou don‚Äôt have to be a lead or a manager to make your team more inclusive and effective.

    "description": "Have you heard about design systems? It's a catchy concept that's been getting quite some attention lately from our friends at the digital UX community. And I think we as a service design community can get a lot of value out of it as well!\n\nHere's my simple understanding of a design system...\n\nThe main idea is that a design system provides you with a standardised set of components and patterns. This standardised set allows you to deliver results more efficiently and with more consistency.\n\nIn an online environment a component might be a button and a pattern might be the steps in the ordering process. \n\nNow I hear you thinking... I don't work with buttons and checkout flows. So how can I as a service designer benefit from a design system? \n\nThat exactly the question I had as well! \n\nFortunately, good friend of the Show and design systems ninja, Dan Mall was willing to come on and lay it all out for us.\n\n[ 1.

The pipe-dream to create a fully modular software system is still alive and strong, so what have we learned over the years and across different practices? And how do teams today adopt a modern view to an age-old problem?\n\nAbout Ahmad\nAhmad is a software developer and advocate of all things open-source. A startup advisor and mentor to entrepreneurs & developers, he founded Tech Masters ‚Äî a developer community of over 10,000+ members engaging in discussions on technology, careers, and learning. He is currently a Fractional CTO supporting multiple startups. Prior to his current role, he was CTO of npm, chief architect for TELUS Digital, and VP of Engineering at Kong. \nhttps://ahmadnassri.com/\n\n--\nTalk #2: The evolution of Shopify‚Äôs color system\nBy Kaelig Deloumeau-Prigent, UX Developer, Shopify\n\nIn this talk, Kaelig covers a case study in how Shopify uses design tokens as the technical foundations of its color system, scaling it to multiple platforms, and with accessible theming in mind.\n\nAbout Kaelig\nKaelig is a UX developer on the Polaris design system team at Shopify. In the past, he worked on a variety of design systems for companies such as Salesforce, the Guardian, the BBC, and the Financial Times. In 2016, he started talking about Design Systems Ops, a set of principles freely inspired from the DevOps movement, applied to front-end and design systems.\nhttps://www.deloumeau.fr/\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

A story about the experience with implementing a design system in a large software company whose culture has always been about the great autonomy of the software development teams. It is about building a structure without a budget and without a dedicated team. Can there be some advantages to it?\n\nAbout Ond≈ôej:\nOnd≈ôej fell in love with UX design in 2008. Since 2012 I have been in charge of the UX & Graphics team at GMC Software Technology, later renamed to Quadient. Our software helps companies who need to communicate with their clients. He feels very strongly about the idea of consistency as part of great user experience. They started with a style guide, then a UI pattern library, and finally, they're working on a design system now.\n\n---\n\nTalk #2: \"How we solve inconsistencies in patterns to improve Quadient Design System\" by Richard Grof, UX designer at Quadient\nThis talk will focus on two main areas:\n- Case study: Removing inconsistencies from UI patterns across the application.\n- Identifying opportunities for continuous improvements of the design system.\n\nAbout Richard:\nRichard work as a UX designer at Quadient. He has a passion for designing for user-friendly and accessible interfaces with meaningful interactions and reusability in mind.\nSponsors:\nSpecial thanks to productboard and Kiwi.com for sponsoring this meetup.\n\n---\n\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems. No matter how you engage with design systems, we all play a role in making information accessible for everyone, and without barriers.\n\nHow can I contribute?\nFollow us on our social channels\nhttps://designsystems.community/chapters/czechia\nhttps://www.meetup.com/dscc_cze/\nhttps://twitter.com/dscc_cze\n\n--\nBy participating in DSC events, you agree to our code of conduct: https://designsystems.community/conduct/",

    "description": "Great documentation empowers your users and helps newcomers familiarize themselves with your product/process. Unfortunately, doing documentation right -- and keeping docs current and accurate -- is a lot of work. Design systems, in particular, depend on solid documentation because the entire process is built around consistency, reusability and scalability. If the documentation falls down, the design system is likely to follow. \n\nCheck out the source code (https://github.com/adekunleoduye/design-system-starter) for Adekunle Oduye‚Äôs presentation for creating a design system starter for Gatsby + Storybook (https://storybook.js.org/), ideal companions for creating a living documentation system. Writing the docs in MDX with Gatsby means making code the source of truth -- and making writing documentation a part of the development process, rather than an afterthought. When documentation is a living part of your code, it‚Äôs front of mind to keep it current. Systemizing the documentation process increases efficiency and productivity, and Adekunle demonstrates a practical path to get it done fast with a Gatsby starter using Gatsby for the code and Storybook for the UI.\n\nConnect with Adekunle to hear more of his thoughts on design systems, UI animation and new frontiers in front end development:\n-  Via his presentation slides: http://adekunleoduye.com/talks/gatsby-days-2020/design-system-documentation-gatsby_virtual-gatsby-days-2020.pdf\n- On his website: http://www.adekunleoduye.com/\n- Find him on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/adekunleoduye/\n- Follow him on Twitter @AdukunleOduye",

The result is a reflection of your team‚Äôs ability to arrive at a simple, single answer in conversations with maintainers and users. This talk is informed by a series of interviews with system designers to get to the bottom of why, and how, communicating your design system is the key to its success.\n\nTalk 2: Designing for Development, building a Design System at Brainly - Patrycja Rozmus (Design system lead at Brainly)\n\nIn this talk, Patrycja will introduce the history of the design system and design processes at Brainly, explain the genesis of their homemade design system tooling that became popular worldwide - Html-Sketchapp. She will also dive into the struggles connected to selling design systems to business and present some takeaways that might be useful for other teams.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

This event does not require background knowledge.\n\n--\nTalk #1: \"Communication between designers and developers, the infinite loop.\" by James Malone, Design Director at NearForm\n\nDesign systems include documentation for many things like colours, content and principals. Collaboration and internal communication however are often not part of this process, but they should be. Drawing on personal experience, James will discuss how to plan and think about collaboration from the start.\n\nAbout James\nJames Malone is the design director at NearForm with over two decades of design experience. James has worked in a multitude of industries managing small and large design teams. James is passionate about Design Operations, improving efficiency through collaboration, and dismantling the fabled gap between design and development.\n\n--\nTalk #2: \"Breaking down silos, automation, workflows, tools and humans.\" by Stuart Giles, Senior Product Designer at NearForm\n\nDesign systems are built to meet the bespoke requirements of a company, team or organisation. Each one is different and unique. In a similar way, the teams that use these systems are unique and different too. Stuart looks at how to break down silos and create tools, workflows and processes that are customised to the unique users who use them.\n\nAbout Stuart\nStuart is a Senior Product Designer at NearForm where he works with large household brands to implement, scale and automate design systems. As a lead product designer he defines the experience of digital products through research, design, and development phases. Stuart is as happy in Sketch as he is at a command line and jumps between the two seamlessly.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

So why does it feel like animation in a design system always falls short? The animation section usually lays dormant aside from a \"fade\", or we craft one-offs for a perfect experience, but each perfect experience becomes less perfect because they don't share the same language. In this talk, we'll break down exactly how to build animations so that they're composable, extendable, and can be used for a multitude of purchases, and still maintain cohesion. We'll talk about how animation in specific requires teams to work together because it's an intersection of design and development: it's harder to throw over a wall. We'll break down exactly how to make it all fit together, for the most seamless collaboration between you and your team.\n\nPresented by Sarah Drasner at Clarity 2018, on December 11th, 2018.

And when we‚Äôre at our best, there isn‚Äôt anything we can't do. So how do we optimize collaboration? How do we work better together even if we don‚Äôt see eye-to-eye with everyone on our teams? And how do we create a culture of empathy when all we can see about everyone around us is our differences?\n\nThis talk will explore empathy in an unusual way: from the perspective of a stutterer.

Then content design patterns emerged. Today, many design systems have embedded content guidelines for each component. Drawing on personal experience, Ryan will discuss how his work as a product content strategist has been shaped by Polaris, Shopify‚Äôs design system.\n\nAbout Ryan\nRyan Bigge is a senior content strategist on Shopify‚Äôs Financial Services team. He spent a decade as a freelance print journalist before going digital. Ryan has talked about about boring UX in Pittsburgh (Abstractions 2019) and improving personalized recommendations in Chicago (IA Summit 2018).\n\n--\nTalk #2: Content for Design Systems: Measuring Success\nJacqui Clydesdale, UX Writer and Content Strategist\n\n‚ÄúWhat does success look like?‚Äù is something we often ask of content, and the answer can be pretty straightforward for a marketing email or an onboarding flow. But what makes for a good metric for the content in a design system? Drawing on her experience in UX and adult language learning, Jacqui will explore who the users of a design system are, what they need from it, and how writers can develop, test and iterate content to meet everyone‚Äôs needs.\n\nAbout Jacqui\nJacqui Clydesdale is a UX writer and content strategist in Toronto. She has a background in linguistics, English literature and second language teaching, so it‚Äôs pretty clear that she loves words. Over the past eight years, she‚Äôs developed digital content for Kobo, Canadian Tire, Fast Retailing (Uniqlo), Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods, Shaw, and several startups. She‚Äôs agnostic when it comes to the Oxford comma.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems. No matter how you engage with design systems, we all play a role in making information accessible for everyone, and without barriers.\n\nHow can I contribute?\nInterested to host, sponsor, or speak at our meetups, email us hello@designsystems.community\n\nFollow us on our social channels\nhttps://designsystems.community/\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Meetup\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Twitter\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Instagram\n\n--\nBy participating in DSC events, you agree to our code of conduct: https://designsystems.community/conduct/",

    "description": "Color is the most relative medium in art. This fact makes working with color in design systems particularly challenging. Few people seem to want to claim to be an expert in color‚Äîperhaps because there‚Äôs an immensely deep amount to learn, or perhaps it‚Äôs because color is one of those things we hate to get wrong. Whatever the reason, color remains a contentious but often critical part of design.\n\nI‚Äôll be sharing my journey into color, from the technical challenges to how people respond to it. We‚Äôll take a look at the efforts required in updating large scale web applications like GitHub, testing the interaction of color with other parts of a design system, creating color naming conventions, color contrast, and color system use outside of the product UI.\n\nPresented by Diana Mounter at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017.

    "description": "Throughout history, our tools have affected how we understand the world. In our young industry, our tools, needs, and processes are constantly changing. We build sites and frameworks and components with the tools we have at hand. As we do, we discover problems, invent solutions, and then invent new tools.\n\nDesign Systems are our current model of making sense of the intersection of front-end code and design. With the tools we have today, what is our working model of a component? How do we define them, create them, and ensure they work at scale? In this talk we‚Äôll discuss how our tools affect our understanding, create a checklist of factors that make a component a component, and how to implement the theory of components with the tools you have at hand.\n\nPresented by Elyse Holladay at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017.

The BBC claims that their design system, GEL enables them to ‚Äúcreate consistent and delightful user experiences‚Äù while Salesforce highlights consistency as one of their four design principles. But what does consistency mean in practice and when can it create conflict in a design system?\n\nIn this talk, we‚Äôll take a look at the differing types of consistency (internal, external, and real-world) and how they work in digital and physical interfaces, and we‚Äôll go a step further and dive into the myriad reasons that inconsistency can make sense, too.

Salesforce, Google, and IBM all feature motion design in their design systems, and there‚Äôs every reason you should, too. When designers and developers agree upon constraints, they can create UI components faster and present a unified, polished look and feel users appreciate.\n\nCommunicating animation is all about identifying patterns and setting boundaries and behavior expectations. This means:\n\n- creating custom easings that reinforce branding and physics\n- choreographing scalable timing values\n- creating a vocabulary of reusable components\n- combining those components into unique yet universal animation patterns.\n\nWhether your project is big or small, if it has a style guide, you will want to include motion design.

    "description": "Style Guides and Pattern Libraries are great tools for documenting the relationships between code and design, but beautiful docs and consistent UI are only half the battle. Somewhere, behind the scenes, those patterns have to live in our code, and hopefully make life easier for developers. We can go beyond ‚Äúliving‚Äù style guides to find tools that encourage and document pattern-making from the ground up, across projects, without adding developer overhead. From Sass maps and Jinja macros, to front-end architecture and style-guide generators ‚Äî let‚Äôs talk about the code patterns that make our UI patterns possible.\n\nPresented by Miriam Suzanne at Clarity 2016, on March 31st, 2016.

Among other things, an accessible design system! I‚Äôll talk about Slack Kit, Slack‚Äôs design system, and a selection of the building blocks that made it possible and accessible. Today Slack Kit powers product development at Slack but that was not always the case, this is the story of how we got here.\n\nAbout George\nGeorge builds digital products for the variety of human abilities. He's done so with Scotiabank, Facebook, TELUS Digital, design agencies, government and most recently with Slack. He's passionate about helping people build accessible products / programs / teams / culture!\n\n--\nTalk #2: International is inclusive\nWinter Wei, UX Manager of Localization @Shopify\n\nDo you remember the last time you tried to use a website or product that‚Äôs not in your language, an app or a payment method that wouldn‚Äôt work in a different country? Do you remember how frustrating that was? The world is literally becoming a village. Considering people from different cultures, speaking different languages, having different preferences and limitations is as important as considering accessibility and anti-discrimination when it comes to inclusive design. In this talk we will cover what internationalization and localization mean for a product company, the consequences of not doing it properly, why design system is the natural place to start this work, how we approach it at Shopify, and the lessons we‚Äôve learnt so far.\n\nAbout Winter\nWinter is the UX Manager of Localization at Shopify, leading the internationalization and localization of Shopify foundations while enabling every teams to build for international markets. Previously she grew and led the design team at Kira Systems where she specialized in designing for AI-human interaction and information retrieval. Some of her research and design work are published in reputable academic venues. She‚Äôs an aspiring cellist, knowing that she may never be Yo-Yo Ma but keeps on trying anyway.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

But did you? For small, fast-moving teams, this kind of initiative can, at times, be seen as too much of an effort and cost. Resources that are being spent on design systems aren‚Äôt being spent on building features for the product. So how can your company have their cake and eat it too? This talk will explore strategies that will help you get support and grow a design system when challenges arise.\n\nAbout Diogo\nDiogo is a product designer living and working in Toronto.

    "description": "Episode 37: Best Starter Kit for a New Design System?\n\nThis week‚Äôs pick: Details design system. A kit that I've used to start scalable and powerful UI and product design systems in an Atomic Design framework for quite some time. Details kit provides a simple yet structured starter for any designer to customise. Better yet, you can download Sketch and/or Figma version of their Atoms (and some of the molecules) for free. It doesn't get better than this, especially if you've been planning to create a decent system for one of your products or services.\n\nNote: we're not affiliated with the tool makers. It's just a great UX tool you should know about.\n\nIn this new weekly UX design, user research and product design tools series I'll share some of the best picks I've encountered to date. You'll find out about the best apps, extensions, websites and other helpful tools.\n\nMore Design Tool Tuesday videos on this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM2Dd2NIn2Cp2lG7wKaYGg3TIk6GP14S6\n\nüôåSUBSCRIBE to this channel to get the latest updates on user experience, design strategy and more:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMEQZDhP_k_YkFnwoCgT7SQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nüëçLike what you see?

    "description": "Episode 7: Developer Handovers with Zeplin\n\nIf you're a Sketch user and have been following along this design system tutorial series you probably have already noticed the gradual transition from the smallest atoms to pages that need to be somehow implemented. Too often expectations and design details get lost in the weeds because of the lack of a common environment to retain all the UI patterns. In this video on design systems, I'll share some of the easiest ways to perform design asset handovers to your front-end developers - Zeplin. \n\nA design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer‚Äôs friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organisations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles.\n\nüìπ Stay tuned for more sessions in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM2Dd2NIn2CqxUkHHiDvDbNIbqbv8ehy_\n\nüìπ New to design systems?

    "description": "Episode 6: Templates and Pages in Design Systems\n\nIn this video, we'll continue where we left off by setting up the initial atomic design system template. We already covered atoms, molecules and organisms in the previous videos. Now's the time to finalise the technical aspects of maintaining the design system and introducing flexible UX templates and pages structure. I'll show you not only how to port existing components, but also what you should do if you plan to introduce new UI patterns: update, maintain and roll out your design system in Sketch app.\n\nA design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer‚Äôs friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organizations.

    "description": "https://addconf.com/2019/schedule/consistency-is-key/\n\nWorking with a design system can be hugely rewarding: layouts can be created and modified using shared components. This should result in faster design and development and consistent designs across the app. But getting there is a slow and painful process. When implementing a design system you have to make many decisions, like: Where do you start? What actually makes a component? And how flexible should components be? This talk will shed some light on these issues by taking you through Deliveroo's process of adopting a design system in its three Android apps.\n\nMore about the conference: https://addconf.com",

At the heart of a successful design system is a collection of sturdy, robust front-end components that powers other applications' user interfaces. This talk covers what's involved in establishing a technical architecture for your design system, including front-end workshop environments, CSS architecture, implementing design tokens, popular libraries like React and Vue.js, deploying design systems, managing updates, and more.\n\nResources: http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-technical-side-of-design-systems-at-css-day-in-amsterdam/\nAbout Brad: http://bradfrost.com\nGet his book, Atomic Design: http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com\nFollow Brad: https://twitter.com/brad_frost\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe",

    "description": "Design systems grew out of a need to build consistent, cohesive visual experiences across devices and platforms, and to centralize and consolidate design efforts. While they create a better user experience, increase the efficiency of teams, and improve the quality of products, design systems need to be more than just inventories and deliverables if they are to be successful. Jina will share her thoughts on using design systems to empower and strengthen your creativity while still keeping its goals of scale, maintainability, and efficiency at heart.\n\nJina Anne is a design systems advocate and coach. At Opvitae, she‚Äôs an advisory board member focused on design.\n\nAt Amazon, Jina was Senior Design Systems Lead. At Salesforce, she was Lead Designer on the Lightning Design System. She led the CSS architecture and style guide for the Apple Online Store. She‚Äôs also worked at GitHub, Engine Yard, Crush + Lovely, and Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, and more. She developed projects with W3C, Mass.gov, FedEx, and more.\n\nJina organizes the premiere design systems conference, Clarity. She founded Design Systems Coalition and its inaugural San Francisco chapter. She runs the Design Systems Slack. And she‚Äôs the Sass core team designer.\n\nJina coauthored Design Systems Handbook, Fancy Form Design, and The Art & Science of CSS. She‚Äôs published several articles. She‚Äôs spoken at conferences including Adobe MAX.\n\nPrint Magazine featured Jina as a leading San Francisco creative. Keep the inspiration going and join us for #AIGADesignConf 2020 in Pittsburgh.

    "description": "Talk recording from React Day Berlin Conference 2018 https://reactday.berlin\n\nInconsistent UI is the enemy of developers and designers alike. And while design systems are a modern and scalable way to solve this challenge, implementing one is not as straightforward as it might seem: from getting buy-in from management to picking your tech stack, rolling it out, and releasing changes to multiple apps ‚Äî there are a lot of things that can go wrong. In this talk, you'll learn how to pitch a design system to your boss, rarely discussed technical caveats and challenges, and how to set your design system up for success from the start.\n\nMonica Lent\nMonica is leading the Web Team at SumUp and is based here in Berlin. Her team is building the web experience that helps hundreds of thousands of small businesses around the world get started accepting card payments and growing their businesses.",

    "description": "For any government service to be put in front of the public, it has to meet the Digital Service Standard, a set of 18 criteria. One of the criteria is that all new source code is made open and published under an open source licence.\n\nThis goes hand in hand with our tenth design principle: make things open: it makes things better.\n\nIt encourages good practice, It makes collaboration easier and people can learn from each other. Beyond that,  it improves transparency. \n\nAnna Shipman, Open Source Lead at the UK‚Äôs Government Digital Service, Steve Marshall, Head of Technical Architecture at the Ministry of Justice, and Armin Keyvanloo, a Scala Developer working on HMRC‚Äôs Multi-Channel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP) talk about the advantages of coding in the open in government.\n\nJoin the conversation at: \nhttps://github.com/alphagov/open-standards/issues \n\nFind out more about the Government Digital Service:\n\nGDS Blog: https://gds.blog.gov.uk/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/gdsteam \nInstagram: https://instagram.com/gdsteam/ \nSubscribe to our YouTube channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/GovDigitalService?sub_confirmation=1",

People are making them, sharing them, writing about them, and talking about them‚Ä¶ even forming entire teams dedicated to working on them. It has been exciting to see the traction they are gaining, and how far they have come through process, automation, and tooling.\nIt truly can be a dream product: a design system that scales across many enterprise products, many devices and platforms, and is open source to a larger developer community. What a fun challenge for systems-minded designers and developers. And starting out, you have a pretty good idea of what the end result will be.\nBut at this scale, there is no end result. There are interesting challenges you will face along the way: internal politics, design changes, business decisions, configuration, deprecation strategies, naming, adoption, onboarding, support, training, governance, resistance‚Ä¶ There are implementations and then undoing of those implementations. Enterprise design systems aren‚Äôt easy.\nBut don‚Äôt let this intimidate you. There are always lessons to be learned and shared. And we as an industry are constantly iterating and improving on our processes. We‚Äôre all in this together.\nIn this session, Jina, a design systems designer, fan, and advocate ‚Äî and who was Lead Designer on the Salesforce Lightning Design System ‚Äî will share some stories and insights into the lessons she has learned designing one of the largest design systems in the industry.\n---------------\nTalk & speaker bio:\nbeyondtellerrand.com/events/duesseldorf-2017/speakers/jina-anne\nInformation about beyond tellerrand:\nbeyondtellerrand.com/\ntwitter.com/btconf",

Central storage of information is not safe or secure, so Verify does it differently.\n\nCompanies and organisations normally use databases to store people's information. Big databases are vulnerable to attack. If someone gets access to a central database, they have access to everything.\n\nVerify works differently. When you use Verify, your information is not stored in a central database.\n\nYou choose a company to verify your identity. The company makes a series of checks with different sources to make sure it's you before you use a government service.\n\nNo one has all the information, and there is no central storage. It keeps your identity and information secure.\n\nGOV.UK Verify.
