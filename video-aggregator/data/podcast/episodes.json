They explore what it means to maintain relevance in a landscape where LLMs increasingly influence product development, and reflect on whether design systems are still for people—or for machines. Elyse shares a clear-eyed yet optimistic take on how AI can enhance, rather than replace, the work of design system practitioners.</p><p>Key Points:</p><ul><li>Design systems are shifting focus from components to solving collaboration and workflow problems.</li><li>AI isn’t replacing systems—it’s changing how they’re used and what they need to support.</li><li>Smaller teams can move faster by focusing on what’s most valuable, not doing everything.</li><li>Documentation is evolving to prioritize practical guidance over polished presentations.</li><li>Design systems are becoming infrastructure for both humans and AI.</li></ul><p>View the <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R5b14nqFdfA31a2du2DcyOLI15e7Nz4Ok_f1ew2Mcs0/edit?usp=sharing'>transcript</a> of this episode.</p><p>Check out our <a href='https://www.knapsack.cloud/events'>upcoming events</a>.</p><p>If you want to get in touch with the show, ask some questions, or tell us what you think, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/design-systems-podcast/?viewAsMember=true'>send us a message over on LinkedIn</a>.</p><p><b>Guest</b></p><p><a href=' https://www.linkedin.com/in/elyseholladay/'>Elyse Holladay (she/her)</a> is a long-time Design Systems practitioner and speaker, currently the Staff Design Engineer for Color Health's Continuum Design System.

But I am also curiously optimistic, and more importantly — I don’t want to use any platform I have to spread even more fear and discontent and drama. So today you’re getting a dose of two things that I love: infrastructure and optimism.</p><p>Drawing from his experience leading design systems at three very large orgs, Sam Anderson from Intuit shares how framing design systems as infrastructure can help them be recognized as essential to business success. He shares his vision for the importance of patterns as the next frontier of systems work, particularly in a rapidly changing tech landscape accelerated by AI, and we talk about what leadership conversations look like.

Amy and Elyse chat about how to spend your first 30-60-90 days, building genuine trust, and why making big changes as a new hire can actually backfire. They commiserate over balancing the overwhelming backlog as a small team, and Amy shares why she thinks cross-training outside your expertise is a must.

We revisit some of the most compelling discussions featuring experts David Calleja, Nick Hahn, Ranjeet Tayi, and Kate Moran. Together, they unravel how AI is transforming the way digital products are designed and developed. From AI's potential as a creative partner to its role in automating repetitive tasks, this episode dives into the profound impact AI is having on design workflows. We explore how AI can serve as a copilot, adapting in real time to deliver personalized user experiences, and discuss the importance of maintaining human oversight to ensure quality and integrity. Whether it's hyper-personalizing user interfaces or enhancing the efficiency of design processes, AI is not set to replace humans but to augment our creativity and productivity. Join us as we explore the exciting possibilities AI brings to the world of design systems.</p><p>Check out the original episodes:</p><ul><li><a href='https://www.buzzsprout.com/887923/episodes/15238316-111-how-ai-is-revolutionizing-design-systems-and-customer-experiences-with-dave-calleja.mp3?download=true'>How AI is Revolutionizing Design Systems and Customer Experiences with Dave Calleja</a></li><li><a href='https://www.buzzsprout.com/887923/episodes/15382348-114-design-systems-and-ways-of-working-nick-hahn-on-collaboration-adoption-and-ai.mp3?download=true'>Design Systems and Ways of Working: Nick Hahn on Collaboration, Adoption, and AI</a></li><li><a href='https://www.buzzsprout.com/887923/episodes/14712486-105-ranjeet-tayi-from-informatica-ai-driven-design.mp3?download=true'>Ranjeet Tayi from Informatica: AI-Driven Design</a></li><li><a href='https://www.buzzsprout.com/887923/episodes/15664684-117-why-kate-moran-thinks-humans-are-essential-to-the-future-of-generative-ui-and-ai.mp3?download=true'>Why Kate Moran Thinks Humans Are Essential to the Future of Generative UI and AI</a></li></ul><p>View the <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ox6wsmvQKdTyED34R_U55RNOEaxixrdlfDktyYxtKdg/edit?usp=sharing'>transcript</a> of this episode.</p><p>Check out our <a href='https://www.knapsack.cloud/events'>upcoming events</a>.</p><p>If you want to get in touch with the show, ask some questions, or tell us what you think, <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/design-systems-podcast/?viewAsMember=true'>send us a message over on LinkedIn</a>.</p><p><b>Sponsor<br/></b>Sponsored by Knapsack, the design system platform that brings teams together.

Smith Schwartz, Product Design Manager, and Tyce Clee, Engineering Manager, walk us through the redesign of Spotify Ads Manager—why it was needed, how they used design systems to make it happen, and what it took to get buy-in. Smith and Tyce tell us about the shift from a playful UI to a more data-dense, enterprise-friendly experience, how their local design system worked alongside Spotify’s global Encore system, and why storytelling (not just metrics) is key to selling design system work internally.

On this episode of <em>The Design Systems Podcast</em>, Chris Strahl sits down with Ben Callahan, co-founder of Sparkbox, to explore the critical role of language and communication in team dynamics, problem-solving, and system structures. Ben shares insights on how linguistic choices shape product creation and drive organization-wide cohesion. He argues that while common ground is essential, design systems should balance order with controlled \"quenched disorder\" to foster innovation, using flexible, layered structures that adapt to unique team needs and create scalable, culturally embedded solutions.

This month’s discussion is about how design systems can foster user trust. Sure, a good set of reusable components can create a more consistent product. But what does that mean for users? According to the folks at U.S. Bank, a more consistent UI is a key driver for user trust and adoption, and they’ll tell us how.</p>",

This has been a favourite question in the last few years of figuring out how to rightly reward folks for contributing, but also how to motivate them to contribute in the first place. Are shout-outs enough? Do we need to tie rewards to the wider company rewards? Should motivation to contribute be intrinsic or extrinsic? Should we be encouraging contributions at all?<br/><br/>Resources: <br/><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xvq7CLlEkw'>Amy Hupe - You design system contribution model is doomed to fail</a><br/><a href='https://abookapart.com/products/you-deserve-a-tech-union'>Ethan Marcotte - You deserve a tech union</a><br/><a href='https://www.ruinedby.design/'>Mike Monteiro - Ruined by design</a></p>",
