    "description": "How do you make the rest of your org care about your design system?\n\nWith the current climate, budgets are being slashed left, right, and center. Because of this, design systems are often at the top of the list for what to put on the chopping block. So, how do we make the rest of the organization care about design systems? How do we show how important it is, and how do we talk about it in the language that non-design systems folks care about? Do we need to change that when we’re talking to senior leadership? How can we get the CEO to care about our design system?\n\nA podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question around design system troubles every two weeks.\n\nMeet Michelle: https://twitter.com/soysaucechin\nMeet Luke: https://twitter.com/lurkmoophy\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

Today, both promise and reality collide in healthcare systems as they grapple with old ways of working, pressures for greater inclusion and equity, and the need to fundamentally reframe core issues. How can we help?\n\n﻿In this insightful and impassioned talk, Ashleigh will identify ways stigmas persist in popular yet problematic healthcare frames, highlight the too-often neglected issues the existing frames obscure, and suggest things we can do as designers and system shapers to help healthcare systems course correct.\n\nYou’ll gain a new perspective, learn when not to make it about people, and may even become inspired to help transform healthcare.\n\nPresented by Ashleigh Axios at Clarity 2022, on November 11th, 2022.

    "description": "Figma is free to use. Sign up here: https://bit.ly/3msp0OV\n\nBy definition, a variable is something that can vary in value or take on multiple values. Variables in Figma store reusable values, like color values and numbers, that can be applied to all kinds of design properties and even prototypes! A variable’s values can also reference other variables, making updating design systems a breeze. In this video, we’ll cover how variables work, and how to use them to represent design tokens and account for different modes and themes.\n\n* Update: When following along with the tutorial at 10:30,  the variable called \".5\" will no longer work.  This is due to our alignment with the W3C spec which doesn't allow periods in names.  Calling the variable \"spacing/half\" will work, instead.\nWe are doing a follow-up in the next coming months where we’ll be separating out the “figma name” from the code syntax, which may let us loosen these restrictions.  Keep an eye out for additional syntax support in the future.\n\nFollow along with the file: https://bit.ly/44bHgC2\n\nLearn about prototyping with variables with our other tutorial: https://bit.ly/3pfKk1h\n\nLearn more about variables in Figma with our additional playground file: https://bit.ly/4490iJc\n\nLearn more about design systems in Figma: https://bit.ly/3os0Afc\n\nHelp center articles:\nGuide to variables: https://bit.ly/3Nh7JaK\nOverview of variables: https://bit.ly/44bD2dG\nCreate and manage variables: https://bit.ly/447B9im\nApply variables to designs: https://bit.ly/3qVsnWo\nModes for variables: https://bit.ly/3qS3GKk\n\nFor more information on using variables with API and development, check out the links here:\n- REST API: https://www.figma.com/developers/api#variables\n- Plugin API docs: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/working-with-variables\n- Import/export variables code sample https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/variables-import-export\n- Styles to variables convert code sample https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/styles-to-variables\n\nChapters: \n00:00 - Intro\n01:17 - Color variables\n03:55 - Create tokens\n06:00 - Apply variables\n07:13 - Styles vs variables\n08:17 - Modes\n10:12 - Number variables\n12:35 - Themes\n14:11 - Wrap up\n____________________________________________________\n\nFind us on ⬇️\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/figma\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/figma\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/figma\nFigma forum: https://forum.figma.com/\n\n____________________________________________________\n\n#Figma #Config #Config2023 #Variables #Designtokens #Tutorial #design #tips #DesignSystems",

Inviting insights and improvements from a design system's community of users is what makes it reliable and representative. So why do so many of us find it so hard to achieve and sustain? Are we going about it all wrong, or is there something more insidious at play here?

Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! \n\nIn this talk, Imran Afzal talks about reflective practice. \n\nWhatever role we play, it’s critical that we stay relevant. Continuous learning is a must. There’s very little allowance for our approach or knowledge to stagnate in UX. However, we all lead busy lives in a fast-paced society. Rarely is there a moment to stop and think. If we’re not jumping from one product release to another, we’re feeling the pressure of delivering high-quality work, quickly. This can harm our long-term success and impact.\n\nHowever, reflective practice can help. By taking time out to think about our actions, we can learn from our experiences and use that knowledge to evolve our mindset. Imran discusses what it means to reflect on our experiences and the impact of that process on our future. The talk explores the benefits of taking time to reflect, while also providing guidance on introducing reflective practice into your work.\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! \n\nWatch Lily Dart discuss the culture and good and bad aspects of design systems. \n\nIf you’re interested in design systems, you’ve no doubt dreamt of the kind of design system you’d like to build. Perhaps you know precisely what tooling you’d use or how you’d structure the components. A design system that is elegant, easy to use, and produces beautiful results. But if you’ve tried creating a design system, you’ll know it’s unlikely you’ll achieve your original aspirations. Arguments over standards, complexity in tooling and abuses, and mis-uses of the libraries are all common pitfalls for new systems. \n\nSo why is it so hard to build a great design system? A successful system is more than UI and code. What underpins every system - good or bad -  is culture. And without the right culture, your beautiful design system will fail. Based on her experience running the first-ever design systems team at Lloyds Banking Group, Lily will be talking about the relationship between design systems and organizational culture. How to identify yours, when to design for it, and when to fight against it.\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "description": "Converge is zeroheight’s one-day design systems conference. On May 18, 2023, we hosted Converge US in San Francisco at the Great Star Theater! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.\n\nVal is a Principal Designer at Adobe and is based out of Pittsburgh, PA.\n\nUX animation works best when it’s designed with the bigger picture in mind, but that’s hard to do if it’s not covered in your design system. Defining a motion language for your brand can help your team to develop a shared vision to work from and give everyone more confidence when working with motion. Covering animation in your design system doesn’t have to be a huge lift. There are foundational steps—like defining your animation contexts, knowing your brand voice—that you can use to get started. In this session, Val will cover what a modern design system should address in its animation guidelines, and how you can start your whole team using animation more effectively.\n\nVal Head: https://twitter.com/vlh\nConference host: Michelle Chin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin/\n\nAbout Converge US: https://zeroheight.com/converge-us\nFind out more about zeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero-height/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.\n\nAdekunle is a Design Engineer - Tech Lead at Plaid based out of Brooklyn, NY.\n\nThe concept of design systems has gained popularity in recent times, and it is widely known by people and organizations alike that they play a crucial role in enhancing the design and development process. But at the moment, design systems need to support multiple products, brands, and color schemes simultaneously, which presents an interesting challenge. As consumer needs continue to change, design systems must also evolve from a rigid framework to a more adaptable and flexible system that can cater to those needs. What approach can we take to ensure that the design system we create meets the requirements of today while remaining adaptable to the changing needs and desires of tomorrow?\n\nAdekunle Oduye: https://twitter.com/adekunleoduye\nConference host: Michelle Chin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin/\nAbout Converge US: https://zeroheight.com/converge-us\n\nFind out more about zeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero-height/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

Before the World Wide Web, academics were building hypertext systems that instead of being linear, unidirectional and constantly broken, that have been all but forgotten. Imagine a world where our documentation, instead of being relatively static and linear, was structured into knowledge graphs – with each small chunk inextricably linked to everything it’s related to. Where links are contextual and speak to each other. And where we can start building our documentation in the same way we build our design systems - systemitized, efficient and structured. Luke will take us through the wonderful world of structured content, and how we can start rethinking the way we document our design systems to make all our lives easier.\n\nLuke Murphy: https://twitter.com/lurkmoophy\nConference host: Michelle Chin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin/\nAbout Converge US: https://zeroheight.com/converge-us\n\nFind out more about zeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero-height/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "description": "⚠️ We apologize - the recording had technical issues. Some of Sarrah's audio is missing and some of it isn't coming from the main mic. \nConverge is zeroheight’s one-day design systems conference. On May 18, 2023, we hosted Converge US in San Francisco at the Great Star Theater! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.\n\nSarrah is the Director of Design at [Honeycomb.io](http://honeycomb.io/) and based out of Zephyrhills, Florida.\n\nLast year, Sarrah talked at Hatch Conf about how their design system, Lattice, had stalled and was essentially dead in the water. Through some tough conversations, She realized that as a leader, she needed to prioritize it. No more working on it in spurts and keeping things moving at a snail's pace.\n\nFast forward to quarter one of this year. They had secured a dedicated spot on the roadmap for Lattice with a PM, Engineering, and Design dedicated to the effort. They had one quarter to make as much headway as possible in evolving our design system into something the whole company could use. That meant considering the elephant in the room – there was no design systems team to pick up the effort after this quarter. How could they ensure they would end up in a different place than before? What could they do in that time to get other teams to adopt and use Lattice in their day-to-day development? Most importantly, who would own the process of adding and developing components once the effort was \"over\"?\n\nIn this talk, Sarrah will go into how they approached it from three distinct perspectives: The design Director (getting support and buy-in), The Designer (coordinating with PM, Eng, and the design team to plan and execute), and The Engineer (coordinating with PM, Design, and working on component migration and development).\n\nSarrah Vesselov: https://twitter.com/SVesselov\nConference host: Michelle Chin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin/\nAbout Converge US: https://zeroheight.com/converge-us\n\nFind out more about zeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero-height/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "description": "A design system is often an expression (for better or worse) of the values of the people that build it. This is why design systems flounder—they are often launched as a bridge between teams without an understanding of the various subcultures of those teams. When companies align their design system with and make them work for their existing company culture, the goals for that system are more easily realized.\n\nIf you feel like you’re swimming upstream with your design system, it could be the result of a cultural problem—not a technical one. It’s time for you to look at your design system from a different angle.\n\nIn this virtual learning event, Ben Callahan will show you how design systems and company culture are inextricably linked and how a deeper understanding of each is necessary to get you where you want to go.\n\n00:00 A Quick Story\n04:11 A Framework for Organizational Culture\n08:52 A Framework for Competing Values\n18:18 The Healthy or Unhealthy Design System Subculture\n32:01 Cultural Compatibilities\n38:27 Can a Design System Subculture Change Organizational Culture?",

    "description": "For International Women’s Day, the theme is #EmbraceEquity, which inspired us to host an edit-a-thon this month. In this recording, our Design Advocate Michelle walks you through the basics of editing Wikipedia, identifies great places for beginners to edit, and provides a list of pages that could be improved or created. \n\nWe decided to host this because there’s a huge gender gap on Wikipedia. In less than 19% of biographies on Wikipedia are about women. Wikipedia is a data source on many things we rely on - from Google’s knowledge panels to what teaches AI systems. When women aren’t represented in Wikipedia, we’re omitted from people’s knowledge and discussion, and our accomplishments go unknown.\n\nThis will be an ongoing project for her and some friends. So if you missed the webinar, you can catch up on this recording and join in a future edit-a-thon session. \n\nEditing Wikipedia is more user-friendly now, making creating and editing pages even easier. By embracing this learning curve, we can work toward better equity and representation of women in Wikipedia and beyond.\n\nLink to slides: https://bit.ly/amp-wit-slides\n\nLink to wiki project page: https://bit.ly/amp-wit-wiki\n\nReach out to Michelle on Twitter: https://twitter.com/soysaucechin\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

He’s currently leading the use and understanding of design tokens within Rangle’s design team and how it can close the gap between designers and engineers. He believes that design tokenization is a powerful methodology that can help scale design systems and solve a lot of company’s pain points. In his spare time, he also likes to rock climb, take photos, game, and obsess over niche hobbies.\r\n\r\nTalk: Why You Should Use Tokens and Tokens Studio\r\n\r\nYou’re using tokens and you don’t even know it! One of the goals of a design system is to close the gap between multiple disciplines and especially between design and development. With the features and tools Figma provides us, this gap becomes smaller. But what if I tell you with the proper integration of design tokens, we can make this gap closer than it was ever before. Sounds great right? Let’s talk about tokens and how it can level up your design system!\r\n\r\nMateo Morris; @_mateomorris\r\n\r\nMateo is the creator of Primo - a new kind of open-source CMS that aims to put code within reach of everyone and anyone (omit). He’s worked as a freelancer, agency developer, and startup founder. Together with his wife Courtney, he started and taught a coding course for refugees in Cairo, Egypt called Cairo Codes which they ran until the beginning of Covid. In his free time he enjoys writing music, cooking, and hanging out with Courtney.\r\n\r\nTalk: Code is for designers, too\r\n\r\nOne of the largest pain points designers face in translating their designs into code is having to go through developers. No-code tools let designers circumnavigate developers, but usually come with the downsides of being generic, restrictive, and unscalable. So what does it look like when code becomes more approachable and designers can access it themselves?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAbout Design Systems Community\r\n\r\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

    "description": "This event took place on October 12, 2022 on Twitter Spaces. It's an open discussion about applied design tokens.\n\nMeet our guests:\n\nEsther Cheran; @EstherCheran\nEsther is one of the Co-founders at Hyma, best known for the Figma Tokens plugin. In 2020 she first coined the term Headless Design System while trying to solve a complex multi-brand design system, which became popular after her talk at `Figma - In the file`. The concept of a Headless Design System using design tokens has since become a widely adopted approach for building multi-brand/theme design systems. When she’s not obsessing about Design Tokens, you likely find her reading a book, sketching or painting.\n\nMike Kamminga; @mikekamminga\nMike has been a Creative Technologist since 1999, living on the edge of design and technology. Currently he's Imagining and building the future of Design Tokens as the CEO at Hyma, the company best known for Figma Tokens. He also pioneered the headless design system concept together with Esther Cheran, which fundamentally changed the way multi-brand design systems are built today.\n\nJames Nash; @c1rrus\nDesign system aficionado, classically trained webmaster, slayer of pixels, DTCG spec editor and occasional fashion terrorist.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems. No matter how you engage with design systems, we all play a role in making information accessible for everyone, and without barriers.\n\nHow can I contribute?\nInterested to host, sponsor, or speak at our meetups, email us toronto@designsystems.community\n\nFollow us on our social channels\nhttps://designsystems.community/\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Meetup\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Twitter\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Instagram",

But it's one thing to come up with a design system for a website, and another to translate it for the people who manage the content that goes into your carefully crafted design system. They say software is eating the world, but I would venture to say that even more people are involved in the care and maintenance of websites, and it's important that they're remembered as the standards rise ever higher.\n\nLet's explore some strategies for translating parts of a design system for editorial needs - the functional spec, if you will - and take a look at some real-world examples of how powerful that can be in a visual editing experience in a popular CMS.\n\nPresented by Helen Hou-Sandi at Clarity 2021, on October 27th, 2021.

I responded with a 541-word essay that became one of the most popular things I’ve ever written. It was widely quoted. A few people even told me it has changed their lives. But here’s the catch: fifteen years later, I’ve begun to realize I was wrong.\n\nHow wrong? Well, that’s for you to decide. Now that I’m at the far end of a 40-year career, I hope this will be a chance for you (and me) to learn from my mistakes.\n\nPresented by Michael Bierut at Clarity 2021, on October 29th, 2021.

Our delivery teams depend on the design system to help provide what good looks like, and often rely on the design systems team to maintain it, add features, and help throughout the contribution process. But what happens when your design systems team disbands?\n\nLet”s talk about the highs and lows of working on a design system, becoming a user of a minimally supported design system, and returning to the design systems' team a little wiser and hopeful. I'll share a bit about our biggest challenge yet, rebuilding trust with the community while ambitiously rebranding on a new technology.\n\nTakeaways:\n- Relate to the personal, emotional rollercoaster, of being on a design systems team\n- Learn about features and practices to make your design system more robust and self-sufficient\n- Learn what to prioritize to continue creating a design system people want to use\n\nPresented by Donna Vitan at Clarity 2021, on October 29th, 2021.

There are tools, books, blog posts, and talks all built around trying to bridge this gap, but what if the key to creating more cohesive and inclusive teams is really the people within those teams? Instead of bridging a gap, what if we eliminate it altogether with a group of people called Design Technologists. They’re typically familiar with design and research best practices, yet also talented at creating accessible, scalable components with APIs that engineering teams can easily understand and utilize. They understand the language of both worlds already, so why not lean into this role and mindset when creating design systems with a shared language. \n\nLet’s discuss what exactly Design Technology entails, how this role creates stronger teams and tighter connections across an organization, and how everyone can think like a Design Technologist, regardless of their title.\n\nPresented by Ayesha Mazrana at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021.

    "description": "Building design systems is a thankless job. It feels like some days the quality of the product's UI is weighing on your shoulders and others like you're being critiqued for stifling the design team's creativity. When you build an internal product for your peers, critical feedback becomes personal and can demotivate or derail your team. It can feel like sprints and quarters are spent reacting to the needs of others, and your roadmap is commanded by the teams you support. Acting in a support role means you're responsible for defining your team's motivation, milestones, success... and how your work impacts the business overall. \n\nWriting this talk began as a way to cope with burnout after 4 years of working on design systems. Intended as a cathartic moment of self-reflection, this talk will pull from personal experiences [in hope of] providing practical strategies that break the cycles of fatigue, stress, and overwhelm; empowering design systems leaders to define their focus and what really matters.\n\nPresented by Lauren LoPrete at Clarity 2021, on October 27th, 2021.

The median US household contains at least 5 devices, with similar trends across comparable markets. For a large part this is due to innovation in the devices space over the past 5 years. New hardware categories like smart speakers have been created, while other categories have gained broader adoption due to category leaders, such as AirPods driving wearables growth.\n\nAt the same time the capabilities of our devices are more inclusive, opening up new ways for people to interact using voice and gesture for the first time. Better still, the more ambient nature of devices like speakers or displays create the possibility for better digital wellbeing and point towards what a post-mobile future might look like.\n\nYet most of our design systems only focus on phones and computers.\n\nLet’s explore how cross-device hardware trends and use cases can help drive our design systems towards a truly responsive and inclusive future.\n\nPresented by Jen Cotton at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021.

    "description": "Some brands have very loyal customers due to their product’s being reliable and having a high quality level. This is the same when constructing design system components that designers and engineers use everyday when building features. You not only need to make sure they’re functional and align to the product's aesthetics, but they also have to be performant, accessible and scalable. Having buggy components will decrease confidence for the design system.\n\nOne way to minimize bugs in components is to use a BDD approach. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a programming style where tests are created from the user’s perspective before code is written. But what are the most effective ways to implement BDD when building components? How can BDD be beneficial to developers and also designers, researchers and QA?\n\nThe audience will learn:\n- The benefits of BDD and TDD\n- Techniques on how to implement BDD into a design system process\n- How to leverage automating testing while building components\n\nPresented by Adekunle Oduye at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021.

I want to share how my team and I have created a collaborative and safe environment for designers to work smarter and be happier when using our design system.\"\n\n--\nTHE ART OF BEING REPLACEABLE IN DESIGN SYSTEMS\nAu, Senior Systems Designer at GitHub\n\nUsing principles of systems theory, design principles and design culture best practices I want to demonstrate that great design systems can be timeless. That they can scale and take on any challenges the future may hold. This is a talk about design culture and soft skill but with a focus on practical examples of how that translates into design decisions and methods.\n\nThe meetup is remote and hosted by the Design System Community Chapter Berlin!\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

    "description": "The language we use to describe effective design systems seems so similar to the language we use to describe how effective teams work.\n\n“Authentic and genuine principles”, “a shared language”, “clear channels of communication”, “clear governance structures”, “frequent checkups”.\n\nSee what I mean? Read any decent article or book on effective design systems or effective teams and these 👆🏾 concepts are gonna come up. Why? Because a team is also a system. It’s just that we don’t think of it that way, because its “people stuff”. So we avoid it. Because “people stuff” is “hard”.\n\nI’d like to convince you otherwise. In this talk I’ll share practical tips on how any team can become more effective when it thinks of itself as a system. Not only that, I’ll show how to do this using some of the core principles and techniques we already know, love, and use to build effective design systems.\n\nYou don’t have to be a lead or a manager to make your team more inclusive and effective. You just need to care about design, systems, and people. That’s why you’re here right?\n\nPresented by Farai Madzima at Clarity 2020, on September 4th, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.",

But design systems are not the biggest umbrella, so to speak—they exist under broader social, political, and infrastructural systems that affect the parameters, limitations, and variables of our system.\n\nInvestigating design systems across many verticals, we'll look to see how design systems are impacted by the systems they live within. And beyond the verticals, we'll look to see how broader systems of power and oppression influence the design systems, and ultimately, the users who use the products defined by them.\n\nWe'll look to see how to assess where our design systems live in broader ecosystems, the challenges inherent, and how to lean into the good, and resist the bad, to ensure we're serving all humans in an equitable and ethical way, maintaining safety and trust.\n\nPresented by Tatiana Mac at Clarity 2019, on August 21st, 2019.

Defining how your brand should express itself in motion gives you the “why” of your UI animation efforts, and establishes a concrete way to ensure your UI animations share a common thread both with each other, and with the rest of your design efforts.\n\nIn this session, Val will show you how to harness the design details of UI animation to reinforce your intended design messaging.

Consistency, headstarts, and shared standards are good for everyone. But where does that leave designers? How do we exercise the advantages of gorgeous art direction and intuitive interaction design? Why does it feel like the job we’ve been successfully doing for years is quickly fading away? Dan Mall has been coaching and working with in-house teams on their design systems for a few years. In this talk, he’ll share what he’s learned about each team member’s role, where to be efficient vs. where to be experimental, and how we can all better collaborate to benefit from everyone’s knowledge and skills.\n\n\n\nPresented by Dan Mall at Clarity 2018, on December 12th, 2018.

A story about the experience with implementing a design system in a large software company whose culture has always been about the great autonomy of the software development teams. It is about building a structure without a budget and without a dedicated team. Can there be some advantages to it?\n\nAbout Ondřej:\nOndřej fell in love with UX design in 2008. Since 2012 I have been in charge of the UX & Graphics team at GMC Software Technology, later renamed to Quadient. Our software helps companies who need to communicate with their clients. He feels very strongly about the idea of consistency as part of great user experience. They started with a style guide, then a UI pattern library, and finally, they're working on a design system now.\n\n---\n\nTalk #2: \"How we solve inconsistencies in patterns to improve Quadient Design System\" by Richard Grof, UX designer at Quadient\nThis talk will focus on two main areas:\n- Case study: Removing inconsistencies from UI patterns across the application.\n- Identifying opportunities for continuous improvements of the design system.\n\nAbout Richard:\nRichard work as a UX designer at Quadient. He has a passion for designing for user-friendly and accessible interfaces with meaningful interactions and reusability in mind.\nSponsors:\nSpecial thanks to productboard and Kiwi.com for sponsoring this meetup.\n\n---\n\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

The result is a reflection of your team’s ability to arrive at a simple, single answer in conversations with maintainers and users. This talk is informed by a series of interviews with system designers to get to the bottom of why, and how, communicating your design system is the key to its success.\n\nTalk 2: Designing for Development, building a Design System at Brainly - Patrycja Rozmus (Design system lead at Brainly)\n\nIn this talk, Patrycja will introduce the history of the design system and design processes at Brainly, explain the genesis of their homemade design system tooling that became popular worldwide - Html-Sketchapp. She will also dive into the struggles connected to selling design systems to business and present some takeaways that might be useful for other teams.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

This event does not require background knowledge.\n\n--\nTalk #1: \"Communication between designers and developers, the infinite loop.\" by James Malone, Design Director at NearForm\n\nDesign systems include documentation for many things like colours, content and principals. Collaboration and internal communication however are often not part of this process, but they should be. Drawing on personal experience, James will discuss how to plan and think about collaboration from the start.\n\nAbout James\nJames Malone is the design director at NearForm with over two decades of design experience. James has worked in a multitude of industries managing small and large design teams. James is passionate about Design Operations, improving efficiency through collaboration, and dismantling the fabled gap between design and development.\n\n--\nTalk #2: \"Breaking down silos, automation, workflows, tools and humans.\" by Stuart Giles, Senior Product Designer at NearForm\n\nDesign systems are built to meet the bespoke requirements of a company, team or organisation. Each one is different and unique. In a similar way, the teams that use these systems are unique and different too. Stuart looks at how to break down silos and create tools, workflows and processes that are customised to the unique users who use them.\n\nAbout Stuart\nStuart is a Senior Product Designer at NearForm where he works with large household brands to implement, scale and automate design systems. As a lead product designer he defines the experience of digital products through research, design, and development phases. Stuart is as happy in Sketch as he is at a command line and jumps between the two seamlessly.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

So why does it feel like animation in a design system always falls short? The animation section usually lays dormant aside from a \"fade\", or we craft one-offs for a perfect experience, but each perfect experience becomes less perfect because they don't share the same language. In this talk, we'll break down exactly how to build animations so that they're composable, extendable, and can be used for a multitude of purchases, and still maintain cohesion. We'll talk about how animation in specific requires teams to work together because it's an intersection of design and development: it's harder to throw over a wall. We'll break down exactly how to make it all fit together, for the most seamless collaboration between you and your team.\n\nPresented by Sarah Drasner at Clarity 2018, on December 11th, 2018.

    "description": "The same general trajectory: a decent idea executed flawlessly by a cohesive team of hard workers. No matter the project, everything can be achieved following this general guideline. But the exact thing that can create global companies, solve impossible problems and bring ideas to life is also the same reason why so many companies fail. That *thing* is us. People. And when we’re at our best, there isn’t anything we can't do. So how do we optimize collaboration? How do we work better together even if we don’t see eye-to-eye with everyone on our teams? And how do we create a culture of empathy when all we can see about everyone around us is our differences?\n\nThis talk will explore empathy in an unusual way: from the perspective of a stutterer. We’ll examine what empathy truly is (and is not) and reveal the specific actions individuals must engage in daily to create a culture of empathy on their team.\n\nPresented by Sharon Steed at Clarity 2018, on December 11th, 2018.

Then content design patterns emerged. Today, many design systems have embedded content guidelines for each component. Drawing on personal experience, Ryan will discuss how his work as a product content strategist has been shaped by Polaris, Shopify’s design system.\n\nAbout Ryan\nRyan Bigge is a senior content strategist on Shopify’s Financial Services team. He spent a decade as a freelance print journalist before going digital. Ryan has talked about about boring UX in Pittsburgh (Abstractions 2019) and improving personalized recommendations in Chicago (IA Summit 2018).\n\n--\nTalk #2: Content for Design Systems: Measuring Success\nJacqui Clydesdale, UX Writer and Content Strategist\n\n“What does success look like?” is something we often ask of content, and the answer can be pretty straightforward for a marketing email or an onboarding flow. But what makes for a good metric for the content in a design system? Drawing on her experience in UX and adult language learning, Jacqui will explore who the users of a design system are, what they need from it, and how writers can develop, test and iterate content to meet everyone’s needs.\n\nAbout Jacqui\nJacqui Clydesdale is a UX writer and content strategist in Toronto. She has a background in linguistics, English literature and second language teaching, so it’s pretty clear that she loves words. Over the past eight years, she’s developed digital content for Kobo, Canadian Tire, Fast Retailing (Uniqlo), Dick’s Sporting Goods, Shaw, and several startups. She’s agnostic when it comes to the Oxford comma.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems. No matter how you engage with design systems, we all play a role in making information accessible for everyone, and without barriers.\n\nHow can I contribute?\nInterested to host, sponsor, or speak at our meetups, email us hello@designsystems.community\n\nFollow us on our social channels\nhttps://designsystems.community/\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Meetup\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Twitter\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Instagram\n\n--\nBy participating in DSC events, you agree to our code of conduct: https://designsystems.community/conduct/",

    "description": "Color is the most relative medium in art. This fact makes working with color in design systems particularly challenging. Few people seem to want to claim to be an expert in color—perhaps because there’s an immensely deep amount to learn, or perhaps it’s because color is one of those things we hate to get wrong. Whatever the reason, color remains a contentious but often critical part of design.\n\nI’ll be sharing my journey into color, from the technical challenges to how people respond to it. We’ll take a look at the efforts required in updating large scale web applications like GitHub, testing the interaction of color with other parts of a design system, creating color naming conventions, color contrast, and color system use outside of the product UI.\n\nPresented by Diana Mounter at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017.

    "description": "Throughout history, our tools have affected how we understand the world. In our young industry, our tools, needs, and processes are constantly changing. We build sites and frameworks and components with the tools we have at hand. As we do, we discover problems, invent solutions, and then invent new tools.\n\nDesign Systems are our current model of making sense of the intersection of front-end code and design. With the tools we have today, what is our working model of a component? How do we define them, create them, and ensure they work at scale? In this talk we’ll discuss how our tools affect our understanding, create a checklist of factors that make a component a component, and how to implement the theory of components with the tools you have at hand.\n\nPresented by Elyse Holladay at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017.

The BBC claims that their design system, GEL enables them to “create consistent and delightful user experiences” while Salesforce highlights consistency as one of their four design principles. But what does consistency mean in practice and when can it create conflict in a design system?\n\nIn this talk, we’ll take a look at the differing types of consistency (internal, external, and real-world) and how they work in digital and physical interfaces, and we’ll go a step further and dive into the myriad reasons that inconsistency can make sense, too. You’ll walk away with a framework for making better trade-offs when deciding for or against consistency.\n\nPresented by Abi Jones at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017.",

    "description": "Animation is key component of beautiful and useful product design. Salesforce, Google, and IBM all feature motion design in their design systems, and there’s every reason you should, too. When designers and developers agree upon constraints, they can create UI components faster and present a unified, polished look and feel users appreciate.\n\nCommunicating animation is all about identifying patterns and setting boundaries and behavior expectations. This means:\n\n- creating custom easings that reinforce branding and physics\n- choreographing scalable timing values\n- creating a vocabulary of reusable components\n- combining those components into unique yet universal animation patterns.\n\nWhether your project is big or small, if it has a style guide, you will want to include motion design. In this talk, you will learn how to bring animation to heel.\n\nPresented by Rachel Nabors at Clarity 2016, on April 1st, 2016. Ends with an interview with Chris Coyier",

    "description": "Style Guides and Pattern Libraries are great tools for documenting the relationships between code and design, but beautiful docs and consistent UI are only half the battle. Somewhere, behind the scenes, those patterns have to live in our code, and hopefully make life easier for developers. We can go beyond “living” style guides to find tools that encourage and document pattern-making from the ground up, across projects, without adding developer overhead. From Sass maps and Jinja macros, to front-end architecture and style-guide generators — let’s talk about the code patterns that make our UI patterns possible.\n\nPresented by Miriam Suzanne at Clarity 2016, on March 31st, 2016.

We know how to design, build, deliver them is like any other digital product development process. And there’s the rub: your system is a product in and of itself, applied to an enterprise's ecosystem of other products built by autonomous teams of designers and developers.\n\nYour strategy needs answers to “What products will use it, when and to what\nextent?” “Who’s our audience?” “Who participates and contributes?” \n“What groups must we align with?” “Who wants it, and — really — who doesn’t?”\n\nWe’ll explore ways to identify and prioritize how to engage your enterprise’s people and products as you spread and sustain a system over time.\n\nPresented by Nathan Curtis at Clarity 2016, on March 31st, 2016.

So why the sudden interest in pattern libraries and design systems on the Web? We’re tasked with creating experiences that look and function beautifully across a dizzying array of devices, browsers, screen sizes, network connections, locales, and environments. That’s a tall order in and of itself, but once you factor in team members, clients, stakeholders, and organizational quirks, things start looking downright intimidating. Style guides and design systems provide solid ground for us to stand on as we tackle this increasingly-diverse Web landscape.

Among other things, an accessible design system! I’ll talk about Slack Kit, Slack’s design system, and a selection of the building blocks that made it possible and accessible. Today Slack Kit powers product development at Slack but that was not always the case, this is the story of how we got here.\n\nAbout George\nGeorge builds digital products for the variety of human abilities. He's done so with Scotiabank, Facebook, TELUS Digital, design agencies, government and most recently with Slack. He's passionate about helping people build accessible products / programs / teams / culture!\n\n--\nTalk #2: International is inclusive\nWinter Wei, UX Manager of Localization @Shopify\n\nDo you remember the last time you tried to use a website or product that’s not in your language, an app or a payment method that wouldn’t work in a different country? Do you remember how frustrating that was? The world is literally becoming a village. Considering people from different cultures, speaking different languages, having different preferences and limitations is as important as considering accessibility and anti-discrimination when it comes to inclusive design. In this talk we will cover what internationalization and localization mean for a product company, the consequences of not doing it properly, why design system is the natural place to start this work, how we approach it at Shopify, and the lessons we’ve learnt so far.\n\nAbout Winter\nWinter is the UX Manager of Localization at Shopify, leading the internationalization and localization of Shopify foundations while enabling every teams to build for international markets. Previously she grew and led the design team at Kira Systems where she specialized in designing for AI-human interaction and information retrieval.

But did you? For small, fast-moving teams, this kind of initiative can, at times, be seen as too much of an effort and cost. Resources that are being spent on design systems aren’t being spent on building features for the product. So how can your company have their cake and eat it too? This talk will explore strategies that will help you get support and grow a design system when challenges arise.\n\nAbout Diogo\nDiogo is a product designer living and working in Toronto. He is currently a Senior Product Designer at League on a mission to help people live better, healthier lives through thoughtful design. He’s also spearheading League’s design system, Genesis. Outside of design Diogo drinks a lot of coffee and plays a lot of soccer, but he also loves architecture, dogs, movies and music. He lived in 4 different countries and his favorite animal is an Otter.\n\n--\nTalk #2: Launching a Lean Design System\nJake Janosik, Manager Product Design, Snaptravel\nMostafa Elhefnawy, Sr. Product Manager, Snaptravel\n\nWhat happens when you work for a small startup and your design system needs to launch while making new features and not holding up growth? We will explore how we approached building a lean and mean design system, what we learned during build and launch, and where we are today because of it.\n\nAbout Jake\nJake is a product designer from Toronto, currently leading and managing the design team at Snaptravel, where he owned the creation of their design system, Atlas. He previously worked at several agencies in Toronto, advising and designing for startups and working inside enterprise companies making impactful products. Outside of work, you can find him in a coffee shop daydreaming, attending loud concerts or hiking around the world.\n\nAbout Mostafa\nMostafa has been in product throughout his whole career both as an individual contributing product manager and as someone that built out and managed a product team. He’s worked on a range of different types of products/businesses such as SaaS, Marketplaces, E-commerce, Native Apps, Web, and Chatbots. Throughout each of his roles, he’s had a very close relationship with the Design team which gave him first-hand exposure to some of the problems that a product and design team faces in the absence of a design system\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

    "description": "Episode 37: Best Starter Kit for a New Design System?\n\nThis week’s pick: Details design system. A kit that I've used to start scalable and powerful UI and product design systems in an Atomic Design framework for quite some time. Details kit provides a simple yet structured starter for any designer to customise. Better yet, you can download Sketch and/or Figma version of their Atoms (and some of the molecules) for free. It doesn't get better than this, especially if you've been planning to create a decent system for one of your products or services.\n\nNote: we're not affiliated with the tool makers. It's just a great UX tool you should know about.\n\nIn this new weekly UX design, user research and product design tools series I'll share some of the best picks I've encountered to date. You'll find out about the best apps, extensions, websites and other helpful tools.\n\nMore Design Tool Tuesday videos on this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM2Dd2NIn2Cp2lG7wKaYGg3TIk6GP14S6\n\n🙌SUBSCRIBE to this channel to get the latest updates on user experience, design strategy and more:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMEQZDhP_k_YkFnwoCgT7SQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n👍Like what you see?

Too often efforts that are done in isolation and that lack necessary buy-ins tend to end up collecting dust. What was meant to be transformative new living product design system becomes a crutch? This video will help you understand how to set up the right structures for people and underlying process so that you can start a system, but also ensure it will become an integral part of new feature design and development. \n\nA design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer’s friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organizations.

Some designers don't even know where to start, others continuously struggle to convey design system value. There is one simple (not easy) workaround to conveying the value the businesses seek immediately. And it doesn't matter if you are using Sketch or Figma or what sort of organisation you're part of. If this is your first initiative with design systems - check the video. These principles will work for almost any design based initiative.\n\nA design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards.

Too often expectations and design details get lost in the weeds because of the lack of a common environment to retain all the UI patterns. In this video on design systems, I'll share some of the easiest ways to perform design asset handovers to your front-end developers - Zeplin. \n\nA design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer’s friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organisations.

    "description": "Episode 17: Data Visualisation and Chart Design System for Sketch\n\nThis week’s pick: Charts for Sketch. A design system made to cover any and all diagram, chart and data visualisation UI patterns. This design system is extremely easy to use and is built with the Atomic design framework in mind. Meaning, you'll have an option to easily maintain this living UX design system document or simply copy-paste the elements you need in your work. This sketch library comes with a lot of cases covered, I couldn't think of anything lacking. Best part? it's free.\n\nNote: we're not affiliated with the tool makers. It's just a great UX tool you should know about.\n\nYou can find this design system here: https://www.ls.graphics/charts\n\nIn this new weekly UX design, user research and product design tools series I'll share some of the best picks I've encountered to date. You'll find out about the best apps, extensions, websites and other helpful tools.\n\nMore Design Tool Tuesday videos on this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM2Dd2NIn2Cp2lG7wKaYGg3TIk6GP14S6\n\n🙌SUBSCRIBE to this channel to get the latest updates on user experience, design strategy and more:  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMEQZDhP_k_YkFnwoCgT7SQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n👍Like what you see?
