If they don't, make sure you publish them!

    "description": "üá®üá≠ FRONT CONFERENCE ZURICH üîó https://frontconference.com/tickets\nüéüÔ∏è Secure your place at this year's conference and join us in person or online.\n\nDesign systems are great for scaling design across complex organisations and products. But in our drive for scale, consistency and standards, have we considered the risks and the cost? What are the problems we may face and how can we overcome them? In this talk, Mark will expose the ugly truth of rolling out design systems; from engineering and code, to designers and stakeholders and provide guidance from his experience of producing design systems for over a decade.\n\nAbout Mark Boulton\nüîó https://twitter.com/markboulton\n\nMark leads digital communications at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) where he‚Äôs building delivery teams, developing a design system for Life Sciences, and trying to figure out how to scale design in a scientific environment where the bottom line is discovery not dollars.\n\nPrior to working at EMBL, Mark was Design Director at Monotype where he led scaling of a new design system across the company‚Äôs portfolio of products. Previously, Mark ran a design studio and worked on design systems for CERN, Al Jazeera, and ESPN.\n\nMark lives in Wales with his wife, two daughters and a dog that thinks it‚Äôs a bear.\n\n=====\nAbout Front Conference Zurich: Where design meets technology.\n\nüîó https://twitter.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.instagram.com/frontzurich/\nüîó https://www.facebook.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontzurich/\n\nDesigners and developers share a common mission - to create amazing experiences. But it's not always easy for these two tribes to communicate. To bridge the gap between design and technology, we created the Front Conference in 2011.\n\nTo create great digital products, we rely on each other: designers on developers and developers on designers. That's why we came up with the idea of a conference for everyone involved in the design and implementation of a front end.\n\nBy staying at the forefront of both design and technology, we've grown to become the largest web conference in Switzerland. Our interests have broadened to reflect the increasing maturity of the industry. We now cover management topics such as design leadership, tech governance and UX strategy.\n\nOur attendees range from juniors to managers, and we attract key speakers to come to Zurich and share their knowledge in talks and workshops. \n\nThe conference has become a place to learn and network, and we have many loyal professionals who come back every year.",

If you manage more than one site, if you support more than one brand, if you want to be more efficient or more consistent or more unified in your digital interface building approach‚Äîthis is the session for you.\n\nWe‚Äôll start with a breakdown of design system concepts, reframing how to think about them in a practical and approachable way (The Anatomy of a Design System).\n- Where design systems live in an organization\n- The four layers of a design system (concepts)\n- The three parts of each layer (tangibles)\n\nThen we‚Äôll dig into the four major concepts covered by the Design System Maturity Model developed from years of work, interviews, and industry-wide surveys.\n\n- The stages of design system maturity\n- How a design system‚Äôs origin story impacts its path through maturity\n- A framework for maturing in a healthy way\n- A framework for maintaining stability\n\nJoin for this info-packed half-hour session!",

    "description": "üá®üá≠ #FRONTZURICH üîó https://frontconference.com/tickets\nüéüÔ∏è Secure your place and join us in person or online.\n\nüë©üèª‚Äçüíª Architecting CSS grid in a design system\nCSS grid has been supported by major browsers since 2017 and based on the State of CSS survey, it is a fairly well known CSS property. In this talk, I'd like to share the thought process and exploration of how CSS grid can be used in a design system meant to be used by a wide audience.\n\n=====\nAbout Chen Hui Jing @huijing \nüîó https://twitter.com/@hj_chen\nüîó https://chenhuijing.com\n\nMy name is Chen Hui Jing. I first dipped my toe into the waters of web development when I built my first HTML website in 2008 for the Malaysia Basketball Association.\n\nFrom there, I discovered the existence of content management systems and migrated the site over to Drupal. I stopped working on the site a year later and put my web development journey on hold (the original site no longer exists either).\n\nAfter a 4-year sabbatical (from web development), I decided to restart this journey by diving in head-first this time. In September 2013, I got a job in the web industry and this website chronicles my experiences as I learn new things, fail spectacularly and make cool stuff along the way.\n\nI also founded Talk.CSS, a meetup around all things CSS, with Chris Lienert, and ran it with my best mate, Gao Wei after Chris returned to Australia.\n\nThe idea for Talk.CSS was born on the Kopi.JS slack channel on October 26, 2015 and within 2 hours, we had a logo, a Gitter channel, a Meetup.com account, a venue for the meetup and a couple speakers. Colour us efficient.\n\nI also have a day job as a Frontend Developer at Shopify, because we all need to pay the bills.\n\n=====\nAbout Front Conference Zurich: Where design meets technology.\n\nüîó https://twitter.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.instagram.com/frontzurich/\nüîó https://www.facebook.com/frontzurich\nüîó https://www.linkedin.com/company/frontzurich/\nüîó https://mastodon.social/@front\n\nDesigners and developers share a common mission - to create amazing experiences. But it's not always easy for these two tribes to communicate. To bridge the gap between design and technology, we created the Front Conference in 2011.\n\nTo create great digital products, we rely on each other: designers on developers and developers on designers. That's why we came up with the idea of a conference for everyone involved in the design and implementation of a front end.\n\nBy staying at the forefront of both design and technology, we've grown to become the largest web conference in Switzerland. Our interests have broadened to reflect the increasing maturity of the industry. We now cover management topics such as design leadership, tech governance and UX strategy.\n\nOur attendees range from juniors to managers, and we attract key speakers to come to Zurich and share their knowledge in talks and workshops. \n\nThe conference has become a place to learn and network, and we have many loyal professionals who come back every year.",

But what are we missing out as we become more rigid about how we define and practice design systems? And what value might lie in loosening our grip?\n\nIn this talk, Amy explores the impact of dogmatism in the field of design systems, and the opportunities a more flexible approach might bring.\n\nPresented by Amy Hupe at Clarity 2022, on November 10th, 2022.

    "description": "Healthcare in the U.S. promises to maintain or improve quality of life by enhancing care while doing ‚Äúno harm.‚Äù And yet, it regularly enforces stigmas. Today, both promise and reality collide in healthcare systems as they grapple with old ways of working, pressures for greater inclusion and equity, and the need to fundamentally reframe core issues. How can we help?\n\nÔªøIn this insightful and impassioned talk, Ashleigh will identify ways stigmas persist in popular yet problematic healthcare frames, highlight the too-often neglected issues the existing frames obscure, and suggest things we can do as designers and system shapers to help healthcare systems course correct.\n\nYou‚Äôll gain a new perspective, learn when not to make it about people, and may even become inspired to help transform healthcare.\n\nPresented by Ashleigh Axios at Clarity 2022, on November 11th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Jeremy Keith.",

    "description": "Figma is free to use. Sign up here: https://bit.ly/3msp0OV\n\nBy definition, a variable is something that can vary in value or take on multiple values. Variables in Figma store reusable values, like color values and numbers, that can be applied to all kinds of design properties and even prototypes! A variable‚Äôs values can also reference other variables, making updating design systems a breeze. In this video, we‚Äôll cover how variables work, and how to use them to represent design tokens and account for different modes and themes.\n\n* Update: When following along with the tutorial at 10:30,  the variable called \".5\" will no longer work.  This is due to our alignment with the W3C spec which doesn't allow periods in names.  Calling the variable \"spacing/half\" will work, instead.\nWe are doing a follow-up in the next coming months where we‚Äôll be separating out the ‚Äúfigma name‚Äù from the code syntax, which may let us loosen these restrictions.  Keep an eye out for additional syntax support in the future.\n\nFollow along with the file: https://bit.ly/44bHgC2\n\nLearn about prototyping with variables with our other tutorial: https://bit.ly/3pfKk1h\n\nLearn more about variables in Figma with our additional playground file: https://bit.ly/4490iJc\n\nLearn more about design systems in Figma: https://bit.ly/3os0Afc\n\nHelp center articles:\nGuide to variables: https://bit.ly/3Nh7JaK\nOverview of variables: https://bit.ly/44bD2dG\nCreate and manage variables: https://bit.ly/447B9im\nApply variables to designs: https://bit.ly/3qVsnWo\nModes for variables: https://bit.ly/3qS3GKk\n\nFor more information on using variables with API and development, check out the links here:\n- REST API: https://www.figma.com/developers/api#variables\n- Plugin API docs: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/working-with-variables\n- Import/export variables code sample https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/variables-import-export\n- Styles to variables convert code sample https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/styles-to-variables\n\nChapters: \n00:00 - Intro\n01:17 - Color variables\n03:55 - Create tokens\n06:00 - Apply variables\n07:13 - Styles vs variables\n08:17 - Modes\n10:12 - Number variables\n12:35 - Themes\n14:11 - Wrap up\n____________________________________________________\n\nFind us on ‚¨áÔ∏è\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/figma\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/figma\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/figma\nFigma forum: https://forum.figma.com/\n\n____________________________________________________\n\n#Figma #Config #Config2023 #Variables #Designtokens #Tutorial #design #tips #DesignSystems",

Inviting insights and improvements from a design system's community of users is what makes it reliable and representative. So why do so many of us find it so hard to achieve and sustain? Are we going about it all wrong, or is there something more insidious at play here?

Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! \n\nIn this talk, Imran Afzal talks about reflective practice. \n\nWhatever role we play, it‚Äôs critical that we stay relevant. Continuous learning is a must. There‚Äôs very little allowance for our approach or knowledge to stagnate in UX. However, we all lead busy lives in a fast-paced society. Rarely is there a moment to stop and think. If we‚Äôre not jumping from one product release to another, we‚Äôre feeling the pressure of delivering high-quality work, quickly. This can harm our long-term success and impact.\n\nHowever, reflective practice can help. By taking time out to think about our actions, we can learn from our experiences and use that knowledge to evolve our mindset. Imran discusses what it means to reflect on our experiences and the impact of that process on our future. The talk explores the benefits of taking time to reflect, while also providing guidance on introducing reflective practice into your work.\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "description": "The first ever ConvergeLDN took place on 21st September as part of World Design Systems Week. Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! \n\nWatch Lily Dart discuss the culture and good and bad aspects of design systems. \n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in design systems, you‚Äôve no doubt dreamt of the kind of design system you‚Äôd like to build. Perhaps you know precisely what tooling you‚Äôd use or how you‚Äôd structure the components. A design system that is elegant, easy to use, and produces beautiful results. But if you‚Äôve tried creating a design system, you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll achieve your original aspirations. Arguments over standards, complexity in tooling and abuses, and mis-uses of the libraries are all common pitfalls for new systems. \n\nSo why is it so hard to build a great design system? A successful system is more than UI and code. What underpins every system - good or bad -  is culture. And without the right culture, your beautiful design system will fail. Based on her experience running the first-ever design systems team at Lloyds Banking Group, Lily will be talking about the relationship between design systems and organizational culture. How to identify yours, when to design for it, and when to fight against it.\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

Defining a motion language for your brand can help your team to develop a shared vision to work from and give everyone more confidence when working with motion. Covering animation in your design system doesn‚Äôt have to be a huge lift. There are foundational steps‚Äîlike defining your animation contexts, knowing your brand voice‚Äîthat you can use to get started. In this session, Val will cover what a modern design system should address in its animation guidelines, and how you can start your whole team using animation more effectively.\n\nVal Head: https://twitter.com/vlh\nConference host: Michelle Chin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin/\n\nAbout Converge US: https://zeroheight.com/converge-us\nFind out more about zeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero-height/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.\n\nAdekunle is a Design Engineer - Tech Lead at Plaid based out of Brooklyn, NY.\n\nThe concept of design systems has gained popularity in recent times, and it is widely known by people and organizations alike that they play a crucial role in enhancing the design and development process. But at the moment, design systems need to support multiple products, brands, and color schemes simultaneously, which presents an interesting challenge. As consumer needs continue to change, design systems must also evolve from a rigid framework to a more adaptable and flexible system that can cater to those needs. What approach can we take to ensure that the design system we create meets the requirements of today while remaining adaptable to the changing needs and desires of tomorrow?\n\nAdekunle Oduye: https://twitter.com/adekunleoduye\nConference host: Michelle Chin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin/\nAbout Converge US: https://zeroheight.com/converge-us\n\nFind out more about zeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero-height/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

Before the World Wide Web, academics were building hypertext systems that instead of being linear, unidirectional and constantly broken, that have been all but forgotten. Imagine a world where our documentation, instead of being relatively static and linear, was structured into knowledge graphs ‚Äì with each small chunk inextricably linked to everything it‚Äôs related to. Where links are contextual and speak to each other. And where we can start building our documentation in the same way we build our design systems - systemitized, efficient and structured.

    "description": "‚ö†Ô∏è We apologize - the recording had technical issues. Some of Sarrah's audio is missing and some of it isn't coming from the main mic. \nConverge is zeroheight‚Äôs one-day design systems conference. On May 18, 2023, we hosted Converge US in San Francisco at the Great Star Theater! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.\n\nSarrah is the Director of Design at [Honeycomb.io](http://honeycomb.io/) and based out of Zephyrhills, Florida.\n\nLast year, Sarrah talked at Hatch Conf about how their design system, Lattice, had stalled and was essentially dead in the water. Through some tough conversations, She realized that as a leader, she needed to prioritize it. No more working on it in spurts and keeping things moving at a snail's pace.\n\nFast forward to quarter one of this year. They had secured a dedicated spot on the roadmap for Lattice with a PM, Engineering, and Design dedicated to the effort. They had one quarter to make as much headway as possible in evolving our design system into something the whole company could use. That meant considering the elephant in the room ‚Äì there was no design systems team to pick up the effort after this quarter. How could they ensure they would end up in a different place than before? What could they do in that time to get other teams to adopt and use Lattice in their day-to-day development? Most importantly, who would own the process of adding and developing components once the effort was \"over\"?\n\nIn this talk, Sarrah will go into how they approached it from three distinct perspectives: The design Director (getting support and buy-in), The Designer (coordinating with PM, Eng, and the design team to plan and execute), and The Engineer (coordinating with PM, Design, and working on component migration and development).\n\nSarrah Vesselov: https://twitter.com/SVesselov\nConference host: Michelle Chin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin/\nAbout Converge US: https://zeroheight.com/converge-us\n\nFind out more about zeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero-height/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "title": "UnConference: Design Systems Culture with Ben Callahan",
    "description": "A design system is often an expression (for better or worse) of the values of the people that build it. This is why design systems flounder‚Äîthey are often launched as a bridge between teams without an understanding of the various subcultures of those teams. When companies align their design system with and make them work for their existing company culture, the goals for that system are more easily realized.\n\nIf you feel like you‚Äôre swimming upstream with your design system, it could be the result of a cultural problem‚Äînot a technical one. It‚Äôs time for you to look at your design system from a different angle.\n\nIn this virtual learning event, Ben Callahan will show you how design systems and company culture are inextricably linked and how a deeper understanding of each is necessary to get you where you want to go.\n\n00:00 A Quick Story\n04:11 A Framework for Organizational Culture\n08:52 A Framework for Competing Values\n18:18 The Healthy or Unhealthy Design System Subculture\n32:01 Cultural Compatibilities\n38:27 Can a Design System Subculture Change Organizational Culture?",

    "title": "Color and contrast for accessible interfaces - Nathan Baldwin",
    "description": "Accessibility is about ensuring people can perceive and operate digital interfaces. For sighted people, this can be a difficult problem to solve. There are a plethora of visual experiences and impairments, and solving for one person‚Äôs challenge may adversely affect another‚Äôs. In other cases, a solution may not actually help the people it is intended to help. For example, dark mode may seem reasonable for photophobia (light sensitive people). However, high contrast text in dark mode can result in optical glare, making text illegible. The way that we can solve for the complexities of individual visual experience is with color personalization. \n\nIn this talk, Nate will discuss the basics of the human visual system, color science, and how they relate to user interfaces. He will use examples from his work creating Adobe Spectrum‚Äôs color system in conjunction with their open source color tool, Leonardo.",

The JSON object should have the following structure:\n\n1. A \"typography\" object containing \"headline\", \"intro\", \"body\", and \"caption\" categories.\n2. Headline category should include H1 to H5.\n3. Font sizes should range from 80px to 12px, with the largest size being 80px and the smallest 12px.\n4. The fontWeight \"normal\" should be named \"Regular\".\n5. Font size and line height tokens should use size names XS to XXL.\n6. Font family, font size, line height, and font weight tokens should be separate hierarchy points, referenced in the \"typography\" object as properties.\n7. Use singular naming for all tokens.\n8. Define font weight values as \"Regular\" and \"Bold\" instead of numeric values.\n9. Provide line height values in pixels.\n10. Use property names like \"{fontSizes.xxl}\" to define all properties of the font styles.\n11. Use Montserrat for the font family\n12. Define a \"type\" for all arrays like here:\n\"xl\": {\n      \"value\": \"64px\",\n      \"type\": \"fontSizes\"\n    }\n13.

The governance flow is simple but can be customized to fit your team's needs. \n\nBilly unpacks the categories with examples and shows you how to adjust as you work through the template.\n\nWith this template, you can educate new team members on building their individual processes and understand how to contribute to the design system.

    "title": "Amplify Webinar: Women in Tech Wikipedia Edit-a-thon",
    "description": "For International Women‚Äôs Day, the theme is #EmbraceEquity, which inspired us to host an edit-a-thon this month. In this recording, our Design Advocate Michelle walks you through the basics of editing Wikipedia, identifies great places for beginners to edit, and provides a list of pages that could be improved or created. \n\nWe decided to host this because there‚Äôs a huge gender gap on Wikipedia. In less than 19% of biographies on Wikipedia are about women. Wikipedia is a data source on many things we rely on - from Google‚Äôs knowledge panels to what teaches AI systems. When women aren‚Äôt represented in Wikipedia, we‚Äôre omitted from people‚Äôs knowledge and discussion, and our accomplishments go unknown.\n\nThis will be an ongoing project for her and some friends. So if you missed the webinar, you can catch up on this recording and join in a future edit-a-thon session. \n\nEditing Wikipedia is more user-friendly now, making creating and editing pages even easier. By embracing this learning curve, we can work toward better equity and representation of women in Wikipedia and beyond.\n\nLink to slides: https://bit.ly/amp-wit-slides\n\nLink to wiki project page: https://bit.ly/amp-wit-wiki\n\nReach out to Michelle on Twitter: https://twitter.com/soysaucechin\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "title": "Integrating Design and Code (DSCC Toronto)",
    "description": "Design Systems Community Chapter (DSCC) Toronto is bringing to you a couple of talks that involve Integrating Design and Code.\r\n\r\nWe have two special guests who will present a talk each about their experiences surrounding this topic.\r\n\r\nThis event is sponsored by Rangle.io.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n\r\n0:49 - Design Systems Community, Housekeeping, and a word from our sponsor\r\n8:28 - Talk 1: Why You Should Use Tokens and Tokens Studio by Brandon Surya\n24:00 - Q&A With Brandon\r\n31:28 - Talk 2: Code is for designers, too by Mateo Morris\n56:08 - Q&A with Mateo and Courtney\r\n1:01:37 - Closing remarks\r\n\r\nIn this session you will learn:\r\n\r\n- How to effectively organize and manage design tokens.\r\n- Considerations for how to enable designs and content managers to integrate with coded results.\r\n\r\nMeet our guests:\r\n\r\nBrandon Surya\r\n\r\nBrandon Surya is a senior product designer at Rangle.io, a modern digital products and platforms consultancy that specializes in building design systems. He‚Äôs currently leading the use and understanding of design tokens within Rangle‚Äôs design team and how it can close the gap between designers and engineers. He believes that design tokenization is a powerful methodology that can help scale design systems and solve a lot of company‚Äôs pain points. In his spare time, he also likes to rock climb, take photos, game, and obsess over niche hobbies.\r\n\r\nTalk: Why You Should Use Tokens and Tokens Studio\r\n\r\nYou‚Äôre using tokens and you don‚Äôt even know it! One of the goals of a design system is to close the gap between multiple disciplines and especially between design and development. With the features and tools Figma provides us, this gap becomes smaller. But what if I tell you with the proper integration of design tokens, we can make this gap closer than it was ever before. Sounds great right? Let‚Äôs talk about tokens and how it can level up your design system!\r\n\r\nMateo Morris; @_mateomorris\r\n\r\nMateo is the creator of Primo - a new kind of open-source CMS that aims to put code within reach of everyone and anyone (omit). He‚Äôs worked as a freelancer, agency developer, and startup founder. Together with his wife Courtney, he started and taught a coding course for refugees in Cairo, Egypt called Cairo Codes which they ran until the beginning of Covid. In his free time he enjoys writing music, cooking, and hanging out with Courtney.\r\n\r\nTalk: Code is for designers, too\r\n\r\nOne of the largest pain points designers face in translating their designs into code is having to go through developers. No-code tools let designers circumnavigate developers, but usually come with the downsides of being generic, restrictive, and unscalable. So what does it look like when code becomes more approachable and designers can access it themselves?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAbout Design Systems Community\r\n\r\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems. No matter how you engage with design systems, we all play a role in making information accessible for everyone, and without barriers.\r\n\r\nHow can I contribute?\r\n\r\nInterested to host, sponsor, or speak at our meetups, email us toronto@designsystems.community\r\n\r\nFollow us on our social channels\r\n\r\nhttps://designsystems.community/\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Meetup\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Twitter\r\n\r\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Instagram\r\n\r\nBy participating in DSC events, you agree to our code of conduct: https://designsystems.community/conduct/",

    "description": "If I were to boil down my entire strategy for working with #designsystem teams, it‚Äôd be this quote from former Intel CEO Andy Grove: ‚ÄúLet chaos reign. Then rein in chaos.‚Äù\n\nFrom a #uidesign standpoint, most teams have let chaos reign for a longtime. The misstep is that, instead of trying to rein in the chaos, they instead try to create a whole new systems that prevents chaos in the first place. That‚Äôs an exercise in futility.\n\nWhen I work with teams, I try to normalize this as a natural cycle. Give people the ability to create chaos. Then spend scheduled, intentional time to rein it in. Rinse and repeat. \n\nIn a future post, I‚Äôll describe my favorite technique for doing this: designating a monthly Systems Week.\n\n#danmallteaches #designsystems #designthinking #uxdesign #chaosisgood #chaosmanagement #designphilosophy #designquotes #designinspiration #designprocess #designstrategy #designstructure #designmethods #designbestpractice #designprinciples #designmindset #designinnovation #designevolution #designadaptation #designsimplicity #designcomplexity #designdiscipline #designconsistency #designflexibility #designreign #designchaos",

    "description": "This event took place on October 12, 2022 on Twitter Spaces. It's an open discussion about applied design tokens.\n\nMeet our guests:\n\nEsther Cheran; @EstherCheran\nEsther is one of the Co-founders at Hyma, best known for the Figma Tokens plugin. In 2020 she first coined the term Headless Design System while trying to solve a complex multi-brand design system, which became popular after her talk at `Figma - In the file`. The concept of a Headless Design System using design tokens has since become a widely adopted approach for building multi-brand/theme design systems. When she‚Äôs not obsessing about Design Tokens, you likely find her reading a book, sketching or painting.\n\nMike Kamminga; @mikekamminga\nMike has been a Creative Technologist since 1999, living on the edge of design and technology. Currently he's Imagining and building the future of Design Tokens as the CEO at Hyma, the company best known for Figma Tokens. He also pioneered the headless design system concept together with Esther Cheran, which fundamentally changed the way multi-brand design systems are built today.\n\nJames Nash; @c1rrus\nDesign system aficionado, classically trained webmaster, slayer of pixels, DTCG spec editor and occasional fashion terrorist.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems. No matter how you engage with design systems, we all play a role in making information accessible for everyone, and without barriers.\n\nHow can I contribute?\nInterested to host, sponsor, or speak at our meetups, email us toronto@designsystems.community\n\nFollow us on our social channels\nhttps://designsystems.community/\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Meetup\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Twitter\nhttp://bit.ly/DSC-Instagram",

But it's one thing to come up with a design system for a website, and another to translate it for the people who manage the content that goes into your carefully crafted design system. They say software is eating the world, but I would venture to say that even more people are involved in the care and maintenance of websites, and it's important that they're remembered as the standards rise ever higher.\n\nLet's explore some strategies for translating parts of a design system for editorial needs - the functional spec, if you will - and take a look at some real-world examples of how powerful that can be in a visual editing experience in a popular CMS.\n\nPresented by Helen Hou-Sandi at Clarity 2021, on October 27th, 2021.

There are tools, books, blog posts, and talks all built around trying to bridge this gap, but what if the key to creating more cohesive and inclusive teams is really the people within those teams? Instead of bridging a gap, what if we eliminate it altogether with a group of people called Design Technologists. They‚Äôre typically familiar with design and research best practices, yet also talented at creating accessible, scalable components with APIs that engineering teams can easily understand and utilize. They understand the language of both worlds already, so why not lean into this role and mindset when creating design systems with a shared language. \n\nLet‚Äôs discuss what exactly Design Technology entails, how this role creates stronger teams and tighter connections across an organization, and how everyone can think like a Design Technologist, regardless of their title.\n\nPresented by Ayesha Mazrana at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021.

    "description": "Building design systems is a thankless job. It feels like some days the quality of the product's UI is weighing on your shoulders and others like you're being critiqued for stifling the design team's creativity. When you build an internal product for your peers, critical feedback becomes personal and can demotivate or derail your team. It can feel like sprints and quarters are spent reacting to the needs of others, and your roadmap is commanded by the teams you support. Acting in a support role means you're responsible for defining your team's motivation, milestones, success... and how your work impacts the business overall. \n\nWriting this talk began as a way to cope with burnout after 4 years of working on design systems. Intended as a cathartic moment of self-reflection, this talk will pull from personal experiences [in hope of] providing practical strategies that break the cycles of fatigue, stress, and overwhelm; empowering design systems leaders to define their focus and what really matters.\n\nPresented by Lauren LoPrete at Clarity 2021, on October 27th, 2021.

This is the same when constructing design system components that designers and engineers use everyday when building features. You not only need to make sure they‚Äôre functional and align to the product's aesthetics, but they also have to be performant, accessible and scalable. Having buggy components will decrease confidence for the design system.\n\nOne way to minimize bugs in components is to use a BDD approach. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a programming style where tests are created from the user‚Äôs perspective before code is written. But what are the most effective ways to implement BDD when building components? How can BDD be beneficial to developers and also designers, researchers and QA?\n\nThe audience will learn:\n- The benefits of BDD and TDD\n- Techniques on how to implement BDD into a design system process\n- How to leverage automating testing while building components\n\nPresented by Adekunle Oduye at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021.

Offering a close-to-JSX syntax for its components, and natively supporting third-party UI frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, it's a new generation of Static Site Generators.\n\nIn this episode, we welcome Matthew Phillips to discuss those new paradigms in Web sites/apps development, how it is chnaging the way we think our views, and how it aims to improve global performance. From a Design System perspective, we talk how we can use Design Tokens in Astro Components, and how we can use it to build static websites like documentation, straight with Astro files!\n\n‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ Resources ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ\n\n- Astro.build: https://astro.build/\n- Astro Components Syntax: https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/\n- Front Matter Script: https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#frontmatter-script\n- Variables in Scripts & Styles: https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/styling/#variables-in-scripts--styles\n- Hoisted Scripts for client's modules: https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#hoisted-scripts\n- Astro XElement: https://www.npmjs.com/package/astro-xelement\n\n- Partial Hydration and Islands Architecture Concept: https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/component-hydration/\n\n- üê• @matthewcp: https://twitter.com/matthewcp\n- https://matthewphillips.info/\n\n- ü™Ñ Backlight Design Systems Editor: https://backlight.dev/?utm_campaign=sessions%3Acds\n- üê• Georges Gomes: https://twitter.com/georges_gomes\n- üê• m4dz: https://twitter.com/m4d_z",

    "title": "Will design systems replace designers? - Hayley Hughes | DesignUp 2018",
    "description": "About the talk:\nToday, nearly every company is trying to create or evolve their own design language system. Often, the goal is to enable designers to create consistently meaningful user experiences. Usually, decisions have already been made in the system before the designers commence working on them, leaving them to question their unique role in the world of design systems. \n\nWhen designers are not spending time rehashing colours and fonts, how can they anticipate and educate themselves in new skills and frameworks that will be required of them?\n\nIn this talk, you will take away best practices for creating and adopting a design language system, as well as key ideas for enabling your company to prepare its' designers for the future.\n\n00:56  The definition of 'design' today.\n01:20  Design is relationships.\n02:31  What is a design system?\n03:08  The Design System Hierarchy of Human Needs.\n05:18  Definition of Design Systems.\n07:00  Airbnb's product today.\n08:53  \"Why the system functions the way it does.\" Defining new parameters and new arguments by the designers: The first order of Design Systems.\n09:07  Journey Systems: The second order of Design Systems.\n10:18  Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: The Use of Storyboards.\n10:39  Using Storyboarding as a way to understanding the customer experience at Airbnb.\n12:15  ‚ÄúWhen we make new services, maintaining journeys is critical for capturing the feeling of each moment in the human experience.‚Äù ‚ÄîHayley Hughes. How key insights are drawn from the journeys.\n12:39  How journeys can inspire collaboration across teams.\n13:24  Creating scorecards at Airbnb.\n14:04  ‚ÄúAlways make sure when you're designing your journeys, that some parts have a specific focus on what the user is doing, what they're unable to do.

    "description": "Have you heard about design systems? It's a catchy concept that's been getting quite some attention lately from our friends at the digital UX community. And I think we as a service design community can get a lot of value out of it as well!\n\nHere's my simple understanding of a design system...\n\nThe main idea is that a design system provides you with a standardised set of components and patterns. This standardised set allows you to deliver results more efficiently and with more consistency.\n\nIn an online environment a component might be a button and a pattern might be the steps in the ordering process. \n\nNow I hear you thinking... I don't work with buttons and checkout flows. So how can I as a service designer benefit from a design system? \n\nThat exactly the question I had as well! \n\nFortunately, good friend of the Show and design systems ninja, Dan Mall was willing to come on and lay it all out for us.\n\n[ 1.

    "description": "Despite the prevalent mythology of the lone creative genius, many of the most innovative contributions spring from the creative chemistry of a group and the blending of everyone‚Äôs ideas and concepts. How can we best leverage this collective wisdom to generate creative synergy and co-create? Let‚Äôs look at the process of recognizing and removing our personal creative blocks, connecting and communicating with others, combining ideas using play, and constructing a collaborative environment to discover effective methods for tapping into a group‚Äôs creative brilliance. Through these steps, you‚Äôll learn to capitalize on the super-linearity of creativity to embrace and leverage diversity to create better together.\n\nPresented by Denise Jacobs at Clarity 2019, on August 20th, 2019. Ends with an interview with Brad Frost.",

A story about the experience with implementing a design system in a large software company whose culture has always been about the great autonomy of the software development teams. It is about building a structure without a budget and without a dedicated team. Can there be some advantages to it?\n\nAbout Ond≈ôej:\nOnd≈ôej fell in love with UX design in 2008. Since 2012 I have been in charge of the UX & Graphics team at GMC Software Technology, later renamed to Quadient. Our software helps companies who need to communicate with their clients. He feels very strongly about the idea of consistency as part of great user experience. They started with a style guide, then a UI pattern library, and finally, they're working on a design system now.\n\n---\n\nTalk #2: \"How we solve inconsistencies in patterns to improve Quadient Design System\" by Richard Grof, UX designer at Quadient\nThis talk will focus on two main areas:\n- Case study: Removing inconsistencies from UI patterns across the application.\n- Identifying opportunities for continuous improvements of the design system.\n\nAbout Richard:\nRichard work as a UX designer at Quadient. He has a passion for designing for user-friendly and accessible interfaces with meaningful interactions and reusability in mind.\nSponsors:\nSpecial thanks to productboard and Kiwi.com for sponsoring this meetup.\n\n---\n\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

The result is a reflection of your team‚Äôs ability to arrive at a simple, single answer in conversations with maintainers and users. This talk is informed by a series of interviews with system designers to get to the bottom of why, and how, communicating your design system is the key to its success.\n\nTalk 2: Designing for Development, building a Design System at Brainly - Patrycja Rozmus (Design system lead at Brainly)\n\nIn this talk, Patrycja will introduce the history of the design system and design processes at Brainly, explain the genesis of their homemade design system tooling that became popular worldwide - Html-Sketchapp. She will also dive into the struggles connected to selling design systems to business and present some takeaways that might be useful for other teams.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

This event does not require background knowledge.\n\n--\nTalk #1: \"Communication between designers and developers, the infinite loop.\" by James Malone, Design Director at NearForm\n\nDesign systems include documentation for many things like colours, content and principals. Collaboration and internal communication however are often not part of this process, but they should be. Drawing on personal experience, James will discuss how to plan and think about collaboration from the start.\n\nAbout James\nJames Malone is the design director at NearForm with over two decades of design experience. James has worked in a multitude of industries managing small and large design teams. James is passionate about Design Operations, improving efficiency through collaboration, and dismantling the fabled gap between design and development.\n\n--\nTalk #2: \"Breaking down silos, automation, workflows, tools and humans.\" by Stuart Giles, Senior Product Designer at NearForm\n\nDesign systems are built to meet the bespoke requirements of a company, team or organisation. Each one is different and unique. In a similar way, the teams that use these systems are unique and different too. Stuart looks at how to break down silos and create tools, workflows and processes that are customised to the unique users who use them.\n\nAbout Stuart\nStuart is a Senior Product Designer at NearForm where he works with large household brands to implement, scale and automate design systems. As a lead product designer he defines the experience of digital products through research, design, and development phases. Stuart is as happy in Sketch as he is at a command line and jumps between the two seamlessly.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

    "description": "Design Systems have changed the way that developers and designers collaborate on fonts, colors, UI structure, forms and the like. So why does it feel like animation in a design system always falls short? The animation section usually lays dormant aside from a \"fade\", or we craft one-offs for a perfect experience, but each perfect experience becomes less perfect because they don't share the same language. In this talk, we'll break down exactly how to build animations so that they're composable, extendable, and can be used for a multitude of purchases, and still maintain cohesion. We'll talk about how animation in specific requires teams to work together because it's an intersection of design and development: it's harder to throw over a wall. We'll break down exactly how to make it all fit together, for the most seamless collaboration between you and your team.\n\nPresented by Sarah Drasner at Clarity 2018, on December 11th, 2018.

No matter the project, everything can be achieved following this general guideline. But the exact thing that can create global companies, solve impossible problems and bring ideas to life is also the same reason why so many companies fail. That *thing* is us. People. And when we‚Äôre at our best, there isn‚Äôt anything we can't do. So how do we optimize collaboration? How do we work better together even if we don‚Äôt see eye-to-eye with everyone on our teams? And how do we create a culture of empathy when all we can see about everyone around us is our differences?\n\nThis talk will explore empathy in an unusual way: from the perspective of a stutterer. We‚Äôll examine what empathy truly is (and is not) and reveal the specific actions individuals must engage in daily to create a culture of empathy on their team.\n\nPresented by Sharon Steed at Clarity 2018, on December 11th, 2018.

Then content design patterns emerged. Today, many design systems have embedded content guidelines for each component. Drawing on personal experience, Ryan will discuss how his work as a product content strategist has been shaped by Polaris, Shopify‚Äôs design system.\n\nAbout Ryan\nRyan Bigge is a senior content strategist on Shopify‚Äôs Financial Services team. He spent a decade as a freelance print journalist before going digital. Ryan has talked about about boring UX in Pittsburgh (Abstractions 2019) and improving personalized recommendations in Chicago (IA Summit 2018).\n\n--\nTalk #2: Content for Design Systems: Measuring Success\nJacqui Clydesdale, UX Writer and Content Strategist\n\n‚ÄúWhat does success look like?‚Äù is something we often ask of content, and the answer can be pretty straightforward for a marketing email or an onboarding flow. But what makes for a good metric for the content in a design system? Drawing on her experience in UX and adult language learning, Jacqui will explore who the users of a design system are, what they need from it, and how writers can develop, test and iterate content to meet everyone‚Äôs needs.\n\nAbout Jacqui\nJacqui Clydesdale is a UX writer and content strategist in Toronto. She has a background in linguistics, English literature and second language teaching, so it‚Äôs pretty clear that she loves words. Over the past eight years, she‚Äôs developed digital content for Kobo, Canadian Tire, Fast Retailing (Uniqlo), Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods, Shaw, and several startups. She‚Äôs agnostic when it comes to the Oxford comma.\n\n--\nAbout Design Systems Community\nDesign Systems Community helps bring people together to share ways of working, successes, and other learnings to encourage best practices in building, scaling, and maintaining design systems.

    "description": "Color is the most relative medium in art. This fact makes working with color in design systems particularly challenging. Few people seem to want to claim to be an expert in color‚Äîperhaps because there‚Äôs an immensely deep amount to learn, or perhaps it‚Äôs because color is one of those things we hate to get wrong. Whatever the reason, color remains a contentious but often critical part of design.\n\nI‚Äôll be sharing my journey into color, from the technical challenges to how people respond to it. We‚Äôll take a look at the efforts required in updating large scale web applications like GitHub, testing the interaction of color with other parts of a design system, creating color naming conventions, color contrast, and color system use outside of the product UI.\n\nPresented by Diana Mounter at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017.

But what does consistency mean in practice and when can it create conflict in a design system?\n\nIn this talk, we‚Äôll take a look at the differing types of consistency (internal, external, and real-world) and how they work in digital and physical interfaces, and we‚Äôll go a step further and dive into the myriad reasons that inconsistency can make sense, too.

Salesforce, Google, and IBM all feature motion design in their design systems, and there‚Äôs every reason you should, too. When designers and developers agree upon constraints, they can create UI components faster and present a unified, polished look and feel users appreciate.\n\nCommunicating animation is all about identifying patterns and setting boundaries and behavior expectations. This means:\n\n- creating custom easings that reinforce branding and physics\n- choreographing scalable timing values\n- creating a vocabulary of reusable components\n- combining those components into unique yet universal animation patterns.\n\nWhether your project is big or small, if it has a style guide, you will want to include motion design. In this talk, you will learn how to bring animation to heel.\n\nPresented by Rachel Nabors at Clarity 2016, on April 1st, 2016. Ends with an interview with Chris Coyier",

Among other things, an accessible design system! I‚Äôll talk about Slack Kit, Slack‚Äôs design system, and a selection of the building blocks that made it possible and accessible.

He's passionate about helping people build accessible products / programs / teams / culture!\n\n--\nTalk #2: International is inclusive\nWinter Wei, UX Manager of Localization @Shopify\n\nDo you remember the last time you tried to use a website or product that‚Äôs not in your language, an app or a payment method that wouldn‚Äôt work in a different country? Do you remember how frustrating that was? The world is literally becoming a village. Considering people from different cultures, speaking different languages, having different preferences and limitations is as important as considering accessibility and anti-discrimination when it comes to inclusive design. In this talk we will cover what internationalization and localization mean for a product company, the consequences of not doing it properly, why design system is the natural place to start this work, how we approach it at Shopify, and the lessons we‚Äôve learnt so far.\n\nAbout Winter\nWinter is the UX Manager of Localization at Shopify, leading the internationalization and localization of Shopify foundations while enabling every teams to build for international markets.

But did you? For small, fast-moving teams, this kind of initiative can, at times, be seen as too much of an effort and cost. Resources that are being spent on design systems aren‚Äôt being spent on building features for the product. So how can your company have their cake and eat it too? This talk will explore strategies that will help you get support and grow a design system when challenges arise.\n\nAbout Diogo\nDiogo is a product designer living and working in Toronto. He is currently a Senior Product Designer at League on a mission to help people live better, healthier lives through thoughtful design. He‚Äôs also spearheading League‚Äôs design system, Genesis.

He‚Äôs worked on a range of different types of products/businesses such as SaaS, Marketplaces, E-commerce, Native Apps, Web, and Chatbots.

A kit that I've used to start scalable and powerful UI and product design systems in an Atomic Design framework for quite some time.

It doesn't get better than this, especially if you've been planning to create a decent system for one of your products or services.\n\nNote: we're not affiliated with the tool makers. It's just a great UX tool you should know about.\n\nIn this new weekly UX design, user research and product design tools series I'll share some of the best picks I've encountered to date.

    "description": "Episode 7: Developer Handovers with Zeplin\n\nIf you're a Sketch user and have been following along this design system tutorial series you probably have already noticed the gradual transition from the smallest atoms to pages that need to be somehow implemented. Too often expectations and design details get lost in the weeds because of the lack of a common environment to retain all the UI patterns. In this video on design systems, I'll share some of the easiest ways to perform design asset handovers to your front-end developers - Zeplin. \n\nA design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer‚Äôs friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organisations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles.\n\nüìπ Stay tuned for more sessions in this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM2Dd2NIn2CqxUkHHiDvDbNIbqbv8ehy_\n\nüìπ New to design systems?

    "description": "Episode 2: Set up an Atomic Design Structure\n\nIn this episode, I'll show you how to quickly set up your Sketch file to better accommodate the Atomic Design steps (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and pages). This is one of the most important steps while creating an easy to maintain and experiment with design pattern library. \n\nA design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer‚Äôs friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organizations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles. \n\nüìπ Stay tuned for more sessions in this playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM2Dd2NIn2CqxUkHHiDvDbNIbqbv8ehy_\n\nüìπ New to design systems?

At the heart of a successful design system is a collection of sturdy, robust front-end components that powers other applications' user interfaces. This talk covers what's involved in establishing a technical architecture for your design system, including front-end workshop environments, CSS architecture, implementing design tokens, popular libraries like React and Vue.js, deploying design systems, managing updates, and more.\n\nResources: http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/the-technical-side-of-design-systems-at-css-day-in-amsterdam/\nAbout Brad: http://bradfrost.com\nGet his book, Atomic Design: http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com\nFollow Brad: https://twitter.com/brad_frost\n\nMore about CSS Day: https://cssday.nl or https://twitter.com/cssdayconf\nReceive conference announcements in your inbox: https://cssday.nl/subscribe",

But what does it mean for a developer to implement a new design system for the company products? Is it also better for the developer? In the talk I will share my experience with implementing a design system. How to share design tokens in the organization? How to create a component library and separate the visual layer from business logic? How do you keep sync between design and code? In this talk I will try to answer these questions, using code examples and relevant tools.\n\nSlides: https://speakerdeck.com/yaelballa/design-system-from-a-developer-point-of-view\n\nYGLF 2019: Code Camp Blog, Yael Balla:\nhttps://www.israel.yglfconf.com/post/meet-the-speaker-yael-balla",

Our interfaces are going more places than ever before, so this shift is essential to help us better understand what our websites consist of in order for us create smart, scalable, maintainable designs. Brad Frost introduces atomic design, a methodology for creating robust design systems. Brad covers how to apply atomic design to implement your very own design system in order to set you, your organization, and your clients up for success.\n\nLearn more about AEA ‚ñ∫ https://aneventapart.com/\nJoin us at AEA ‚ñ∫ https://aneventapart.com/events\nAEA on Twitter ‚ñ∫ https://twitter.com/aneventapart SUBSCRIBE to the AEA YouTube channel ‚ñ∫ https://bit.ly/AEA-YT-SUBSCRIBE\n\nNext event: Online Together‚ÄìHuman-Centered Design, Monday, July 20.\nSpanning the spectrum from good design principles to novel content strategy, to improving load times to emotional considerations, this single-day online web design conference will focus on how to best serve our users as they face unprecedented challenges and stress.\n\nSee the full agenda and register now: https://aneventapart.com/event/online-0720",

When your team is small, investing in design systems can seem unnecessary or feel like a luxury you can't afford. Many companies don't employ people to focus on design systems until the inefficiencies of not having one become too painful to bear.\n\nI'll share examples from building design systems at GitHub, show you how this can improve the design and development workflow, and help you to understand when you need to start building design systems and how much of a system you might need.",
