Today, both promise and reality collide in healthcare systems as they grapple with old ways of working, pressures for greater inclusion and equity, and the need to fundamentally reframe core issues. How can we help?\n\nÔªøIn this insightful and impassioned talk, Ashleigh will identify ways stigmas persist in popular yet problematic healthcare frames, highlight the too-often neglected issues the existing frames obscure, and suggest things we can do as designers and system shapers to help healthcare systems course correct.\n\nYou‚Äôll gain a new perspective, learn when not to make it about people, and may even become inspired to help transform healthcare.\n\nPresented by Ashleigh Axios at Clarity 2022, on November 11th, 2022.

    "description": "Design Systems as a practice is a relatively young and growing part of the design and engineering community. For many design systems, they are built at different stages of a company‚Äôs life‚Äîfor older companies, to manage the chaos and debt of existing design and product decisions, for younger companies to wrangle a growing organization and team to help them scale for the future.\n\nAs DoorDash‚Äôs first product designer and frontend engineer, Kathryn has seen the impact of building a design system from the very earliest days as a small, scrappy team of 8 engineers and 1 designer, all the way to IPO in 2020, to a company now with thousands of engineers and a design team of a 100+. She‚Äôll talk through the lessons she‚Äôs learned, the ways she and her team have adapted to the different needs of a company at different stages, how no matter what stage you‚Äôre at as a company, you can find value in a design systems practice.\n\nPresented by Kathryn Gonzalez at Clarity 2022, on November 10th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Sam Kapila.",

    "title": "Figma tutorial: Intro to variables",
    "description": "Figma is free to use. Sign up here: https://bit.ly/3msp0OV\n\nBy definition, a variable is something that can vary in value or take on multiple values. Variables in Figma store reusable values, like color values and numbers, that can be applied to all kinds of design properties and even prototypes! A variable‚Äôs values can also reference other variables, making updating design systems a breeze. In this video, we‚Äôll cover how variables work, and how to use them to represent design tokens and account for different modes and themes.\n\n* Update: When following along with the tutorial at 10:30,  the variable called \".5\" will no longer work.  This is due to our alignment with the W3C spec which doesn't allow periods in names.  Calling the variable \"spacing/half\" will work, instead.\nWe are doing a follow-up in the next coming months where we‚Äôll be separating out the ‚Äúfigma name‚Äù from the code syntax, which may let us loosen these restrictions.  Keep an eye out for additional syntax support in the future.\n\nFollow along with the file: https://bit.ly/44bHgC2\n\nLearn about prototyping with variables with our other tutorial: https://bit.ly/3pfKk1h\n\nLearn more about variables in Figma with our additional playground file: https://bit.ly/4490iJc\n\nLearn more about design systems in Figma: https://bit.ly/3os0Afc\n\nHelp center articles:\nGuide to variables: https://bit.ly/3Nh7JaK\nOverview of variables: https://bit.ly/44bD2dG\nCreate and manage variables: https://bit.ly/447B9im\nApply variables to designs: https://bit.ly/3qVsnWo\nModes for variables: https://bit.ly/3qS3GKk\n\nFor more information on using variables with API and development, check out the links here:\n- REST API: https://www.figma.com/developers/api#variables\n- Plugin API docs: https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/working-with-variables\n- Import/export variables code sample https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/variables-import-export\n- Styles to variables convert code sample https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples/tree/master/styles-to-variables\n\nChapters: \n00:00 - Intro\n01:17 - Color variables\n03:55 - Create tokens\n06:00 - Apply variables\n07:13 - Styles vs variables\n08:17 - Modes\n10:12 - Number variables\n12:35 - Themes\n14:11 - Wrap up\n____________________________________________________\n\nFind us on ‚¨áÔ∏è\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/figma\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/figma\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/figma\nFigma forum: https://forum.figma.com/\n\n____________________________________________________\n\n#Figma #Config #Config2023 #Variables #Designtokens #Tutorial #design #tips #DesignSystems",

Inviting insights and improvements from a design system's community of users is what makes it reliable and representative. So why do so many of us find it so hard to achieve and sustain? Are we going about it all wrong, or is there something more insidious at play here?

Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! \n\nIn this talk, Imran Afzal talks about reflective practice. \n\nWhatever role we play, it‚Äôs critical that we stay relevant. Continuous learning is a must. There‚Äôs very little allowance for our approach or knowledge to stagnate in UX. However, we all lead busy lives in a fast-paced society. Rarely is there a moment to stop and think. If we‚Äôre not jumping from one product release to another, we‚Äôre feeling the pressure of delivering high-quality work, quickly. This can harm our long-term success and impact.\n\nHowever, reflective practice can help. By taking time out to think about our actions, we can learn from our experiences and use that knowledge to evolve our mindset. Imran discusses what it means to reflect on our experiences and the impact of that process on our future. The talk explores the benefits of taking time to reflect, while also providing guidance on introducing reflective practice into your work.\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! \n\nWatch Lily Dart discuss the culture and good and bad aspects of design systems. \n\nIf you‚Äôre interested in design systems, you‚Äôve no doubt dreamt of the kind of design system you‚Äôd like to build. Perhaps you know precisely what tooling you‚Äôd use or how you‚Äôd structure the components. A design system that is elegant, easy to use, and produces beautiful results. But if you‚Äôve tried creating a design system, you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll achieve your original aspirations. Arguments over standards, complexity in tooling and abuses, and mis-uses of the libraries are all common pitfalls for new systems. \n\nSo why is it so hard to build a great design system? A successful system is more than UI and code. What underpins every system - good or bad -  is culture. And without the right culture, your beautiful design system will fail. Based on her experience running the first-ever design systems team at Lloyds Banking Group, Lily will be talking about the relationship between design systems and organizational culture. How to identify yours, when to design for it, and when to fight against it.\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

    "description": "A design system is often an expression (for better or worse) of the values of the people that build it. This is why design systems flounder‚Äîthey are often launched as a bridge between teams without an understanding of the various subcultures of those teams. When companies align their design system with and make them work for their existing company culture, the goals for that system are more easily realized.\n\nIf you feel like you‚Äôre swimming upstream with your design system, it could be the result of a cultural problem‚Äînot a technical one. It‚Äôs time for you to look at your design system from a different angle.\n\nIn this virtual learning event, Ben Callahan will show you how design systems and company culture are inextricably linked and how a deeper understanding of each is necessary to get you where you want to go.\n\n00:00 A Quick Story\n04:11 A Framework for Organizational Culture\n08:52 A Framework for Competing Values\n18:18 The Healthy or Unhealthy Design System Subculture\n32:01 Cultural Compatibilities\n38:27 Can a Design System Subculture Change Organizational Culture?",

    "title": "Amplify Webinar: Women in Tech Wikipedia Edit-a-thon",
    "description": "For¬†International Women‚Äôs Day, the theme is¬†#EmbraceEquity, which inspired us to host an edit-a-thon this month. In this recording, our Design Advocate Michelle walks you through the basics of editing Wikipedia, identifies great places for beginners to edit, and provides a list of pages that could be improved or created. \n\nWe decided to host this because there‚Äôs a huge gender gap on Wikipedia. In less than 19% of biographies on Wikipedia are about women. Wikipedia is a data source on many things we rely on - from Google‚Äôs knowledge panels to what teaches AI systems. When women aren‚Äôt represented in Wikipedia, we‚Äôre omitted from people‚Äôs knowledge and discussion, and our accomplishments go unknown.\n\nThis will be an ongoing project for her and some friends. So if you missed the webinar, you can catch up on this recording and join in a future edit-a-thon session. \n\nEditing Wikipedia is more user-friendly now, making creating and editing pages even easier. By embracing this learning curve, we can work toward better equity and representation of women in Wikipedia and beyond.\n\nLink to slides: https://bit.ly/amp-wit-slides\n\nLink to wiki project page: https://bit.ly/amp-wit-wiki\n\nReach out to Michelle on Twitter: https://twitter.com/soysaucechin\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/michelletchin\n\nzeroheight: https://bit.ly/3DEvORN\n\nFind us on social:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroheight\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/zero...\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/zeroheighthq",

But it's one thing to come up with a design system for a website, and another to translate it for the people who manage the content that goes into your carefully crafted design system. They say software is eating the world, but I would venture to say that even more people are involved in the care and maintenance of websites, and it's important that they're remembered as the standards rise ever higher.\n\nLet's explore some strategies for translating parts of a design system for editorial needs - the functional spec, if you will - and take a look at some real-world examples of how powerful that can be in a visual editing experience in a popular CMS.\n\nPresented by Helen Hou-Sandi at Clarity 2021, on October 27th, 2021.

They‚Äôre typically familiar with design and research best practices, yet also talented at creating accessible, scalable components with APIs that engineering teams can easily understand and utilize. They understand the language of both worlds already, so why not lean into this role and mindset when creating design systems with a shared language. \n\nLet‚Äôs discuss what exactly Design Technology entails, how this role creates stronger teams and tighter connections across an organization, and how everyone can think like a Design Technologist, regardless of their title.\n\nPresented by Ayesha Mazrana at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021.

    "description": "Building design systems is a thankless job. It feels like some days the quality of the product's UI is weighing on your shoulders and others like you're being critiqued for stifling the design team's creativity. When you build an internal product for your peers, critical feedback becomes personal and can demotivate or derail your team. It can feel like sprints and quarters are spent reacting to the needs of others, and your roadmap is commanded by the teams you support. Acting in a support role means you're responsible for defining your team's motivation, milestones, success... and how your work impacts the business overall. \n\nWriting this talk began as a way to cope with burnout after 4 years of working on design systems. Intended as a cathartic moment of self-reflection, this talk will pull from personal experiences [in hope of] providing practical strategies that break the cycles of fatigue, stress, and overwhelm; empowering design systems leaders to define their focus and what really matters.\n\nPresented by Lauren LoPrete at Clarity 2021, on October 27th, 2021.

Better still, the more ambient nature of devices like speakers or displays create the possibility for better digital wellbeing and point towards what a post-mobile future might look like.\n\nYet most of our design systems only focus on phones and computers.\n\nLet‚Äôs explore how cross-device hardware trends and use cases can help drive our design systems towards a truly responsive and inclusive future.\n\nPresented by Jen Cotton at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021. Ends with an interview with Mina Markham.",

    "description": "Some brands have very loyal customers due to their product‚Äôs being reliable and having a high quality level. This is the same when constructing design system components that designers and engineers use everyday when building features. You not only need to make sure they‚Äôre functional and align to the product's aesthetics, but they also have to be performant, accessible and scalable. Having buggy components will decrease confidence for the design system.\n\nOne way to minimize bugs in components is to use a BDD approach. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a programming style where tests are created from the user‚Äôs perspective before code is written. But what are the most effective ways to implement BDD when building components? How can BDD be beneficial to developers and also designers, researchers and QA?\n\nThe audience will learn:\n- The benefits of BDD and TDD\n- Techniques on how to implement BDD into a design system process\n- How to leverage automating testing while building components\n\nPresented by Adekunle Oduye at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021.

    "description": "At the close of 2020, our team shipped dark mode for GitHub. It was an immensely popular feature with our customers, but also turned out to be a great tool for design systems adoption internally. We didn‚Äôt just build dark mode though, we built a color system that enabled us to ship other popular and necessary themes too. In this talk I‚Äôd like to shine a light on the infrastructure behind dark mode, show how themeability is not just for color, and share why I think a themeable design system will help you scale into the future.\n\nPresented by Diana Mounter at Clarity 2021, on October 29th, 2021.

    "description": "When your type and color say one thing, but your use of animation says another, things can get confusing. Defining how your brand should express itself in motion gives you the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of your UI animation efforts, and establishes a concrete way to ensure your UI animations share a common thread both with each other, and with the rest of your design efforts.\n\nIn this session, Val will show you how to harness the design details of UI animation to reinforce your intended design messaging. By using every tool at our disposal, we can create more expressive products that feel cohesive across all of today's diverse contexts.\n\nPresented by Marcy Sutton at Clarity 2019, on August 20th, 2019.

So why does it feel like animation in a design system always falls short? The animation section usually lays dormant aside from a \"fade\", or we craft one-offs for a perfect experience, but each perfect experience becomes less perfect because they don't share the same language. In this talk, we'll break down exactly how to build animations so that they're composable, extendable, and can be used for a multitude of purchases, and still maintain cohesion. We'll talk about how animation in specific requires teams to work together because it's an intersection of design and development: it's harder to throw over a wall. We'll break down exactly how to make it all fit together, for the most seamless collaboration between you and your team.\n\nPresented by Sarah Drasner at Clarity 2018, on December 11th, 2018.

    "description": "The same general trajectory: a decent idea executed flawlessly by a cohesive team of hard workers. No matter the project, everything can be achieved following this general guideline. But the exact thing that can create global companies, solve impossible problems and bring ideas to life is also the same reason why so many companies fail. That *thing* is us. People. And when we‚Äôre at our best, there isn‚Äôt anything we can't do. So how do we optimize collaboration? How do we work better together even if we don‚Äôt see eye-to-eye with everyone on our teams? And how do we create a culture of empathy when all we can see about everyone around us is our differences?\n\nThis talk will explore empathy in an unusual way: from the perspective of a stutterer. We‚Äôll examine what empathy truly is (and is not) and reveal the specific actions individuals must engage in daily to create a culture of empathy on their team.\n\nPresented by Sharon Steed at Clarity 2018, on December 11th, 2018.

Whatever the reason, color remains a contentious but often critical part of design.\n\nI‚Äôll be sharing my journey into color, from the technical challenges to how people respond to it. We‚Äôll take a look at the efforts required in updating large scale web applications like GitHub, testing the interaction of color with other parts of a design system, creating color naming conventions, color contrast, and color system use outside of the product UI.\n\nPresented by Diana Mounter at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017.

Please be kind. :)\n\n‚Äî\n\nOne benefit of design systems is that they help ensure consistency across surfaces, platforms, and projects. The BBC claims that their design system, GEL enables them to ‚Äúcreate consistent and delightful user experiences‚Äù while Salesforce highlights consistency as one of their four design principles. But what does consistency mean in practice and when can it create conflict in a design system?\n\nIn this talk, we‚Äôll take a look at the differing types of consistency (internal, external, and real-world) and how they work in digital and physical interfaces, and we‚Äôll go a step further and dive into the myriad reasons that inconsistency can make sense, too. You‚Äôll walk away with a framework for making better trade-offs when deciding for or against consistency.\n\nPresented by Abi Jones at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017.",

Salesforce, Google, and IBM all feature motion design in their design systems, and there‚Äôs every reason you should, too. When designers and developers agree upon constraints, they can create UI components faster and present a unified, polished look and feel users appreciate.\n\nCommunicating animation is all about identifying patterns and setting boundaries and behavior expectations. This means:\n\n- creating custom easings that reinforce branding and physics\n- choreographing scalable timing values\n- creating a vocabulary of reusable components\n- combining those components into unique yet universal animation patterns.\n\nWhether your project is big or small, if it has a style guide, you will want to include motion design.

So why the sudden interest in pattern libraries and design systems on the Web?

That‚Äôs a tall order in and of itself, but once you factor in team members, clients, stakeholders, and organizational quirks, things start looking downright intimidating.

A kit that I've used to start scalable and powerful UI and product design systems in an Atomic Design framework for quite some time. Details kit provides a simple yet structured starter for any designer to customise. Better yet, you can download Sketch and/or Figma version of their Atoms (and some of the molecules) for free. It doesn't get better than this, especially if you've been planning to create a decent system for one of your products or services.\n\nNote: we're not affiliated with the tool makers. It's just a great UX tool you should know about.\n\nIn this new weekly UX design, user research and product design tools series I'll share some of the best picks I've encountered to date.

This is one of the most important steps while creating an easy to maintain and experiment with design pattern library. \n\nA design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer‚Äôs friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organizations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles. \n\nüìπ Stay tuned for more sessions in this playlist:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM2Dd2NIn2CqxUkHHiDvDbNIbqbv8ehy_\n\nüìπ New to design systems?
