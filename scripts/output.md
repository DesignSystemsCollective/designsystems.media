There are millions of websites and applications that are endlessly evolving, many of which are operating on different systems and devices. 

Most products aren’t creating static, cookie-cutter experiences. They’re creating complex universes of interconnected ones. Growing organizations need tools and processes that empower teams to scale consistent experiences. Many of them are turning to design systems as a potential solution.

In this lesson, we’ll:

- Learn what a design system is and what’s included in one;
- Explore the problems a design system can help solve;
- Help you identify when you need one;
- And highlight a few things to consider as you start your design systems journey.

Documentation is the how. It communicates the purpose of all these aspects of your design system and how best to apply them.

Documentation can look like:

- On-canvas annotations for components in design files
- Style and component descriptions in Figma
- Naming-structures in a library or codebase
- Written articles and guides
- or dedicated websites and tools

Processes are just as important as the tools and assets within the system. It’s important to establish these with your contributors before a design system goes live.

They capture the mechanics and governance for managing a design system:

- How to make updates to a system and share them with others
- Who to give feedback to and how
- How to get changes to the system approved
- How to collaborate with cross-functional teams
- How to provide training to new members of the team
- and more

## [Figma tutorial: Intro to variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ONxxlJnvdM)

Figma is free to use. Sign up here: https://bit.ly/3msp0OV

By definition, a variable is something that can vary in value or take on multiple values. Variables in Figma store reusable values, like color values and numbers, that can be applied to all kinds of design properties and even prototypes! A variable’s values can also reference other variables, making updating design systems a breeze. In this video, we’ll cover how variables work, and how to use them to represent design tokens and account for different modes and themes.

* Update: When following along with the tutorial at 10:30,  the variable called ".5" will no longer work.  This is due to our alignment with the W3C spec which doesn't allow periods in names.  Calling the variable "spacing/half" will work, instead.
We are doing a follow-up in the next coming months where we’ll be separating out the “figma name” from the code syntax, which may let us loosen these restrictions.  Keep an eye out for additional syntax support in the future.

## [UnConference: Design Systems Culture with Ben Callahan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV-qvJ-F48Q)

A design system is often an expression (for better or worse) of the values of the people that build it. This is why design systems flounder—they are often launched as a bridge between teams without an understanding of the various subcultures of those teams. When companies align their design system with and make them work for their existing company culture, the goals for that system are more easily realized.

If you feel like you’re swimming upstream with your design system, it could be the result of a cultural problem—not a technical one. It’s time for you to look at your design system from a different angle.

In this virtual learning event, Ben Callahan will show you how design systems and company culture are inextricably linked and how a deeper understanding of each is necessary to get you where you want to go.

## [Getting Started with Design Systems | Create a Design System in Sketch, Ep1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3eVHGTIzTI)

Episode 1: Getting Started with Design Systems

Note: apologies for potato sound quality... microphones are still tricky to get right.

This video will kickstart the new mini-tutorial series on creating your own design system using Sketch app. I’ll walk you through key steps, caveats, pros and cons to making a design system and more. 

A design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer’s friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organizations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles.

## [Templates and Pages in Design Systems - Create a Design System in Sketch, Ep6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E940UPw57U)

Episode 6: Templates and Pages in Design Systems

In this video, we'll continue where we left off by setting up the initial atomic design system template. We already covered atoms, molecules and organisms in the previous videos. Now's the time to finalise the technical aspects of maintaining the design system and introducing flexible UX templates and pages structure. I'll show you not only how to port existing components, but also what you should do if you plan to introduce new UI patterns: update, maintain and roll out your design system in Sketch app.

A design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer’s friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organizations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles.

## [Developer Handovers with Zeplin - Create a Design System in Sketch, Ep7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgz4KiC2Bjw)

Episode 7: Developer Handovers with Zeplin

If you're a Sketch user and have been following along this design system tutorial series you probably have already noticed the gradual transition from the smallest atoms to pages that need to be somehow implemented. Too often expectations and design details get lost in the weeds because of the lack of a common environment to retain all the UI patterns. In this video on design systems, I'll share some of the easiest ways to perform design asset handovers to your front-end developers - Zeplin.

## [Design Systems: Getting Business Buy-in - Create a Design System in Sketch, Ep8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlBziCCzHuk)

Episode 8: Design Systems: Getting Business Buy-in 

In this video, I'll discuss the biggest issue that designers and engineers alike face when trying to introduce the very first atomic design system -- getting the buy-in from the business. Some designers don't even know where to start, others continuously struggle to convey design system value. There is one simple (not easy) workaround to conveying the value the businesses seek immediately. And it doesn't matter if you are using Sketch or Figma or what sort of organisation you're part of. If this is your first initiative with design systems - check the video. These principles will work for almost any design based initiative.

## [Making Design System a Success - Create a Design System in Sketch, Ep9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sod5l0leBMM)

Episode 9: Making Design System a Success

In this episode for creating fully functional atomic design systems from scratch, I'll talk about 2 vital parts making this effort a success. Too often efforts that are done in isolation and that lack necessary buy-ins tend to end up collecting dust. What was meant to be transformative new living product design system becomes a crutch? This video will help you understand how to set up the right structures for people and underlying process so that you can start a system, but also ensure it will become an integral part of new feature design and development.

## [Best Starter Kit for a New Design System? - Design Tool Tuesday, Ep37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnB_3pVLsCI)

Episode 37: Best Starter Kit for a New Design System?

This week’s pick: Details design system. A kit that I've used to start scalable and powerful UI and product design systems in an Atomic Design framework for quite some time. Details kit provides a simple yet structured starter for any designer to customise. Better yet, you can download Sketch and/or Figma version of their Atoms (and some of the molecules) for free. It doesn't get better than this, especially if you've been planning to create a decent system for one of your products or services.

Note: we're not affiliated with the tool makers. It's just a great UX tool you should know about.

In this new weekly UX design, user research and product design tools series I'll share some of the best picks I've encountered to date. You'll find out about the best apps, extensions, websites and other helpful tools.
