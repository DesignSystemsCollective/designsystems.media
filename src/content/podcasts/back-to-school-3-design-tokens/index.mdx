[Amy Hupe](https://twitter.com/Amy_Hupe) and [Geri Reid](https://twitter.com/gerireid) are back in the class to teach you all about design tokens. They break it down, so you leave after acing the pop quiz. There’s a lot of chatter about design tokens. Why do you need tokens? And how do you architect them when there’s so much conflicting advice?
