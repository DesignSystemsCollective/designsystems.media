[üì≤ Text the show your thoughts!](https://www.buzzsprout.com/twilio/text_messages/2417527/open_sms)

If the way we're building design systems has a fatal flaw, it's "waiting for enough investment to get it right." **In this episode, Brian teaches us to not wait for permission and how your product teams' success is your success.** Brian reminds us how important it is to remember that we're all on the same team, building the same product‚Äîand why internal politics and storytelling matters way more than components. Plus, why design systems are like toilets (not a Dad joke, I promise) and why Brian and I think "measuring the system is hard" is a beautiful thing.
