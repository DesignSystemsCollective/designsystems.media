Y‚Äôall, I‚Äôll be honest. Some days, I‚Äôm scared and nervous and uncomfortable with AI‚Äôs emergence, and implications, too. But I am also curiously optimistic, and more importantly ‚Äî I don‚Äôt want to use any platform I have to spread even more fear and discontent and drama. So today you‚Äôre getting a dose of two things that I love: infrastructure and optimism.

Drawing from his experience leading design systems at three very large orgs, Sam Anderson from Intuit shares how framing design systems as infrastructure can help them be recognized as essential to business success. He shares his vision for the importance of patterns as the next frontier of systems work, particularly in a rapidly changing tech landscape accelerated by AI, and we talk about what leadership conversations look like. Plus, Sam drops a spicy take that he believes AI won‚Äôt destroy design system jobs but make us even more valuable.
