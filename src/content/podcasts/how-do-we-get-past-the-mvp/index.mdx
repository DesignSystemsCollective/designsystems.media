We examine that critical phase in the life of a design system: moving beyond the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Launching an MVP is just the beginning, but what comes next? Michelle and Luke discuss strategies for advocating for more resources, ensuring your work is recognized and adequately resourced, and not just seen as a “free” addition from your team. Drawing from our own experiences and those of other teams, we share practical advice on selling your design system’s ongoing value to stakeholders.
