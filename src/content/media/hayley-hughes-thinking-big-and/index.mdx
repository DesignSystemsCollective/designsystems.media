One constant of design systems is that they’re always changing. As they morph and grow, our understanding of them evolves. In this talk, I’d like to share examples of how apparently small shifts in design systems can make a big difference in how we think about them, and how we continue to recast their role. I’d also like to celebrate the diversity of systems, and highlight the variety of ways they’re fit for purpose.

Presented by Hayley Hughes at Clarity 2022, on November 11th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Jeremy Keith.
