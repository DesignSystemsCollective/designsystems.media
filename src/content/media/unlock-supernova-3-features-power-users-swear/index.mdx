Go beyond documentation and make your design system work for your team. 🚀

Many teams spend months or even years building a design system, but too often, it stops at documentation and manual handoffs. Supernova helps you turn that investment into something your team actively uses, queries, and builds with every day.

In this webinar, you’ll learn how to:

Find answers fast: Ask AI feature makes your system conversational, empowering designers and engineers to find the right information without leaving their workflow.

Work in context: Access system data directly in the IDE with MCP for faster implementation and fewer mistakes.

Automate building: Streamline exports from Figma to code, keeping design and development in sync.

Prototype confidently: Use real design system constraints to validate ideas faster and avoid surprises in production.
