We’ve seen the web community create style tiles, element collages, style guides, pattern libraries, and a slew of other tools in order to break interfaces down to their atomic elements. Our interfaces are going more places than ever before, so this shift is essential to help us better understand what our websites consist of in order for us create smart, scalable, maintainable designs. Brad Frost introduces atomic design, a methodology for creating robust design systems. Brad covers how to apply atomic design to implement your very own design system in order to set you, your organization, and your clients up for success.
