⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

This week we're pleased to welcome Adam Argyle (@argyleink) on the show! An occasion to talk about Open Props and improve our Tech Sample demoing it in Backlight.

We discuss on CSS specificity, Custom Properties, animations and transitions, and way more. Then we create a `palette` component, dedicated to our very specific needs in our Design System, based on Open Props Custom Properties collection.
