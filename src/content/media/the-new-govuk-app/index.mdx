The GOV.UK app is here.

The first version is available to download in app stores. Anyone in the UK with a smartphone who downloads it can now - for the first time - personalise their GOV.UK experience. 

The app enables each user to easily tailor their homepage by choosing the topics that matter most to them. As a signed-in experience, the GOV.UK app remembers the pages people have visited and what theyâ€™ve searched for previously, and gets them quickly to the content they care most about.

Download the app now at https://www.GOV.UK/app
Find out more about the app on the Government Digital Service blog at https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2025/07/01/the-gov-uk-app-is-here/
