Config 2024: The value of opinions in design systems (Nate Baldwin, Senior Staff Designer, Adobe)

Creating and managing a multi-brand design system requires cross-departmental and cross-functional collaboration and contribution. However, in order to provide long-term success for the entire product ecosystem, systems designers and developers must ensure contributions and collaborative outcomes can scale appropriately within the constraints of each brand, and the flexibility to support primary use cases for all teams. Without a strong opinionated team, contributions can become a Trojan horse for your design system; introducing unscalable methods and fragmenting the system to a point where it breaks down.Â
