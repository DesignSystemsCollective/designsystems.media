Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Scott Riley
Author, Mindful Design
(Day 1/2, talk 06)

TALK: LESS DESIGN, MORE SYSTEMS
Design—especially with the emergence of design systems—has a long and tumultuous relationship with systems thinking. In this talk, we’ll explore the concept of ‘systemic design’, with a focus on two core topics: sense–making and placemaking. Firstly, we’ll explore the broad notion of what makes a system a system. Secondly, we’ll look at making sense of the systems with which (and within which) our work is created, and how they impact every facet of our design work. Finally, we’ll look at how systemic, nonlinear environments can represent a new paradigm for designed experiences.

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
