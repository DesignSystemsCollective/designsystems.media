There are millions of websites and applications that are endlessly evolving, many of which are operating on different systems and devices.

Most products aren’t creating static, cookie-cutter experiences. They’re creating complex universes of interconnected ones. Growing organizations need tools and processes that empower teams to scale consistent experiences. Many of them are turning to design systems as a potential solution.

In this lesson, we’ll:

- Learn what a design system is and what’s included in one;
- Explore the problems a design system can help solve;
- Help you identify when you need one;
- And highlight a few things to consider as you start your design systems journey.
