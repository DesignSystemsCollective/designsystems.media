Join Geri, a seasoned design systems explorer with 8 years of adventures under her belt, as she navigates the uncharted territories of accessibility in a major product org. With no playbook in hand, Geri’s quest is one we can all relate to: figuring it out as we go along.

In this ‘choose your own adventure’ session, you’ll discover how the principles of design systems can illuminate a path through any new challenge. Come prepared to laugh, learn, and maybe even get a little lost as we embark on a journey of getting teams onboard with digital accessibility.
