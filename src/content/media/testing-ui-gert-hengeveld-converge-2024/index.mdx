Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Gert Hengeveld
Staff Software Engineer, Chromatic
(Day 2/2, talk 03)

TALK: TESTING UI
Storybook is an industry-standard tool for building design systems. Maintaining those systems can be a challenge, but Storybook is here to help. In this talk, Gert takes you on a journey to fully utilize various testing tools and strategies, so your design system can thrive.

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
