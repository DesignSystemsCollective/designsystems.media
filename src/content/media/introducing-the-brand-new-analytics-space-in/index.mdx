We've revampled Analytics in zeroheight to give you more information about design system adoption and possible improvements. Now, you can see:

üìà Total styleguide views and how they're trending over time
‚úçÔ∏è Insights on individual pages including page feedback
üîé Search feedback to see where viewers are looking for information and coming up empty

The Analytics space is available on our Enterprise plans. We'd love to show you a demo: https://zeroheight.com/demo/
