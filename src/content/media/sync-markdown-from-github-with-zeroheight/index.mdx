We just made a big update! Now, you can add both public and private repos from GitHub to zeroheight. Once added, you can sync markdown on any page. To styleguide viewers, the content will appear natively (just like anything else on zeroheight). And after making changes in GitHub, you can display them in zeroheight with a quick refresh.

This new feature is available on our Pro and Enterprise plans. Get in touch with us and we'd be happy to tell you more about it: https://zeroheight.com/inquire/professional
