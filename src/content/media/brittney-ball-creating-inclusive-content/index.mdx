Have you ever attempted to learn something new only to find that most of the content was either too hard to follow/understand and or left you more confused than when you first started, too technical, or doesn’t hold your attention?

This talk will get into why inclusive content is important, how to make sure the content creating is inclusive, and how creators, learners, and companies can all benefit from inclusive content.

Presented by Brittney Ball at Clarity 2020, on September 4th, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
