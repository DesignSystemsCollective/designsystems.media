Note: Miriam was filling in for Amélie Lamont who fell very ill and was unable to attend the conference. Miriam found out she was speaking less than 30 minutes before having to present.

I built Susy, a Sass grid system that can generate any grid technique you like — but I haven't used it in years. I'll show you how various grid systems work, and how to avoid using them. For those few cases where a grid really is required, we'll talk about the best ways to roll your own, so you're not relying on a bloated library to make decisions for you. We'll also look at the new layout toys — from flexbox to CSS Grid — and how to get started with only a few lines of code.

- When to use floats, CSS Grid, flexbox, custom properties, and other techniques.
- How to make grid-math simple, and lose the grid-system.
- How to make grid-systems work for you when you need them.

Presented by Miriam Suzanne at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017. Ends with an interview with Una Kravets
