I built Susy, a Sass grid system that can generate any grid technique you like — but I haven't used it in years. I'll show you how various grid systems work, and how to avoid using them. For those few cases where a grid really is required, we'll talk about the best ways to roll your own, so you're not relying on a bloated library to make decisions for you. We'll also look at the new layout toys — from flexbox to CSS Grid — and how to get started with only a few lines of code.

- When to use floats, CSS Grid, flexbox, custom properties, and other techniques.
- How to make grid-math simple, and lose the grid-system.
- How to make grid-systems work for you when you need them.

Presented by Miriam Suzanne at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017. Ends with an interview with Una Kravets
