⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

Emails coding is often a poor parent of web development. Dealing with issues from old rendering engines and a lot of platforms with a certain lack of compliance doesn't help email developers.

With the help of Thomas Defossez, we go down the rabbit hole of email development and learn how design systems are the best way to ensure rendering consistency across emails platforms.
