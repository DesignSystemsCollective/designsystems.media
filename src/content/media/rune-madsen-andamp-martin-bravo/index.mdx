Talk previously called "Graphic Design Systems".

In this talk, design duo Rune Madsen and Martin Bravo will talk about their work in the intersection of graphic design and programming languages. The talk will focus on key concepts from Madsen’s book Programming Design Systems and how these same ideas influence their work when developing design systems for digital products, dynamic identities, or custom design tools.

Presented by Rune Madsen & Martin Bravo at Clarity 2019, on August 20th, 2019. Ends with an interview with Brad Frost.
