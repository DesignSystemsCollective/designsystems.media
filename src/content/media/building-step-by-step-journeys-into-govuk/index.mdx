In May 2019, the Government Digital Service (GDS) won a D&AD Award for Service Design, for their step by step navigation work.

Here, Kate Ivey-Williams, Service Design Lead at GDS, explains the work.

Step by step journeys are a way of breaking down the complex tasks that millions of people use GOV.UK to do, such as getting married or divorced, into clear and complete user journeys. The work saves users, and government, time and money.
