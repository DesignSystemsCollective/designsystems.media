The Emerging Technology Development Programme has been designed to create a deployable cadre of specialists with the skills, knowledge and confidence to advise on the application of emerging technologies, like Artificial Intelligence, to solve governmentâ€™s most difficult problems.

Following a successful pilot earlier in 2018, the GDS Academy has opened the programme for applications across the Civil Service. Two participants talk about their experience on the pilot.
