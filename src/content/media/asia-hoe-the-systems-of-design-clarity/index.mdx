Design, and in turn, Design Systems, are innately political. When done well, design makes products and services more accessible, inclusive, and equitable. But what about the systems that enable and teach us the expression of design? Looking at everything from the software and hardware we use, to the internet service providers that enable us to enjoy cloud based software, this talk reveals the inequity in the systems that power design, and what we can do about it to enable a brighter, more diverse, and more inclusive future.

Presented by Asia Hoe at Clarity 2020, on September 3rd, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
