Config 2024: Adopting foundations at scale (Kylor Hall, Principal Engineer, Atlassian)

The Atlassian Design System has undertaken a multi-year effort to drive the adoption of our foundational offerings across both code and Figma. They’ve shipped a few hundred thousand figma variables, components, and standardized opinions to more than 500 designers and 2,500 frontend engineers across Atlassian. They’ll describe how they got this work prioritized at Atlassian, and how they delivered it through changing culture with education, automation, and standardization.


Featuring: Kylor Hall, Principal Engineer, Atlassian
