On 3 February 2015, the Government Digital Service hosted Sprint 15, a chance for colleagues from all over government to catch up, swap notes and tips, and find out more about the UK government's digital transformation programme. We welcomed guests from France, Estonia and the United States, as well as Minister for the Cabinet Office Francis Maude, Martha Lane Fox, and the Prime Ministerâ€™s Digital Economy Advisor Baroness Shields.
