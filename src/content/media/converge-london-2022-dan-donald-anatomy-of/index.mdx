The first ever ConvergeLDN took place on 21st September as part of World Design Systems Week. Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems!

In this talk, Dan Donald explores how you can introduce design tokens.

As a design system matures, we come across new concepts that help us make it better. There’s new requirements that come along, design changes we couldn’t anticipate. Design systems support consistency but also vehicles for communication and change. Here we look at how you can introduce design tokens considering theming and really bring out the power of what your system can be.
