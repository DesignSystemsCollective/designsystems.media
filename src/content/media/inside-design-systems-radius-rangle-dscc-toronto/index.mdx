Design Systems Community Chapter (DSCC) Toronto is proud to host our first meetup of 2021. This year we’ve decided to try out a new format of spotlighting various design systems in our community.

This March spotlight will be on Radius. Rangle.io’s design system. They will share their perspective of building design systems from the agency side.
