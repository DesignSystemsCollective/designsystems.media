Using Web Components as a base block for your design systems components library is a way to maximize the compatibility with a lot of frontend frameworks and interfaces. In this episode, we have a look at a Theme Switch component made using Web Components, and we reuse it in a Nunjucks-based design system, styling it using design tokens. Let's go!
