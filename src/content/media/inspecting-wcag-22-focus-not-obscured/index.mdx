This was the first in a series of workshops focussing on the new Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 criteria, run by the GOV.UK Design System team.

This particular workshop concentrated on the drafted 'Focus not Obscured' criteria from WCAG 2.2.

Facilitators:

David Cox (accessibility specialist)
Imran Hussain (community designer)
Chris Ballantine-Thomas (interaction designer)

While the workshop was a two hour interactive event, this video is edited down to just cover the learning and instructional portions.

In the workshop we:

- Introduced WCAG and the new guidelines
- Looked at the Focus not Obscured criteria in more detail
- Assessed some examples to see whether they meet the criteria or fail
- Talked about strategies to resolve some of the problems we uncover
