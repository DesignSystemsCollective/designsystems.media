In this video, I'll be sharing my favorite tip for creating beautiful and accessible digital color palettes that follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines that pass with flying (cough) colors (cough). The WCAG 2.0 AA guidelines recommend a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 to make it easy for everyone to see and understand content. I'll show how you to use this principle in a design application like Figma with the help of a few of my other favorite tools. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced designer, this tip is sure to help you create visually appealing and inclusive designs.
