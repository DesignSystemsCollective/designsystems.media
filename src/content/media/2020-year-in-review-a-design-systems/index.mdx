Hosted by Design Systems Community Chapter Toronto
on YouTube
on December 2, 2020

Design Systems Community Chapter (DSCC) Toronto is proud to host an end-of-year live panel on December 2, 2020. We’re bringing together industry leaders to discuss the impact of COVID-19 to our day-to-day, evolved collaboration with our design system peers, and how the new normal may shape industries in the future.

## Meet the panelists:

Ash Guillaume, Systems Designer at GitHub

Ash is currently a systems designer at GitHub where he maintains the Figma resources for Primer, GitHub's design system. In addition to diving deep into the layers of components, Ash creates tools and resources for his team to help them work smarter, faster, and happier. Prior to GitHub Ash was the lead marketing designer at Postman (the API tool) where he helped to shape the brand and marketing materials.
Outside of design systems, Ash can be found riding his bike(s) near the beach or spending time with his partner and their dog.

Ethelia’s a transplant to California from Hong Kong. Primarily focused in the digital space, she’s detail-oriented, gently opinionated, and a bit of a perfectionist. Ethelia currently works as an Interaction Designer at YouTube.

I’m an Ottawa based designer working on design systems at Shopify. An interesting fact about me is one of my first jobs was illustrating t-shirt designs for Harley Davidson... lots of flames and chrome.
