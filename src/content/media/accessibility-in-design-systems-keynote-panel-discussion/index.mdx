The theme for Design System Day 2022 was ‘Inclusivity by Design’, and one key area of inclusivity is accessibility. To help us explore the intersection between accessibility and design systems, we assembled a panel of professionals who have a connection to both accessibility work and design systems. Our panellists come from a varied set of UK civil service, broader public sector and private sector organisations.
 
Our accessibility panellists:

David Cox, Senior accessibility specialist, Government Digital Service (moderator)
Anna E. Cook, Senior designer for accessibility on Azure, Microsoft
Michael Cheung, Frontend developer working on accessibility for the design system, NHS Digital
Philip Strain, Product lead for accessibility & design systems, Miro
Shabana Ali, Accessibility frontend developer, HMRC
Sophie Beaumont, Accessibility lead, BBC WebCore
