Config 2024: Design system adoption addiction (Pim Strengers & Olena Musatova, Booking.com)

Design systems are more than component libraries; they include tooling, documentation, release management, and CI automation. In this session, Olena and Pim discuss how treating tooling as a part of the design system can help you transition to cohesive releases spanning across all environments where your design system is present. Thier experience of working with 150+ teams shows how that allowed them to ship system-wide features at Booking.com without asking product teams to spend time on their adoption.

Featuring: Pim Strengers, Senior Designer, Booking.com & Olena Musatova, Senior Software Engineer, Booking.com
