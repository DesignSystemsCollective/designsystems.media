It's not the new iPhone, but you might love it if you're into design systems! âœ¨ðŸ’™

We present to you Unboxing ðŸ“¦ Design Systems, where we analyze design systems made on Figma, on a live stream, using Figma files, and exploring documentation!

We're starting with Base, by Uber, with Raquel Pereira and Bruno Figueiredo.
