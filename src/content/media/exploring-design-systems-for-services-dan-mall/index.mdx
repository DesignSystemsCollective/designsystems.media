Have you heard about design systems? It's a catchy concept that's been getting quite some attention lately from our friends at the digital UX community. And I think we as a service design community can get a lot of value out of it as well!

Here's my simple understanding of a design system...

The main idea is that a design system provides you with a standardised set of components and patterns. This standardised set allows you to deliver results more efficiently and with more consistency.

In an online environment a component might be a button and a pattern might be the steps in the ordering process. 

Now I hear you thinking... I don't work with buttons and checkout flows. So how can I as a service designer benefit from a design system? 

That exactly the question I had as well! 

Fortunately, good friend of the Show and design systems ninja, Dan Mall was willing to come on and lay it all out for us.
