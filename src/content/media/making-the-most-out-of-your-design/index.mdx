Do you know how your design system is used over time? Or which teams and projects use your components, and how to identify usage patterns that can help improve them? Just like how we measure products and features to make improvements, there needs to be a way to measure the impact and usage of a design system so that we can make informed decisions. In this session, June, Developer Advocate at Zeplin, will uncover how Hosh'ki, a Design System Engineer at Optimizely is tackling design system adoption leveraging data using Zeplin's newest product — Omlet, a component analytics tool for devs.
