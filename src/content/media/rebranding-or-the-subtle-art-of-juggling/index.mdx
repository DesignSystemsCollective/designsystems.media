Rebranding is an inevitable, exciting, yet often feared milestone that all companies have to face. We’re excited to share behind-the-scenes learnings from our experience launching a rebrand in 3 months whilst maintaining two active design systems. This talk will provide insights from both brand and product on how to best translate abstract guidelines into UX/UI principles. Finally, we’ll aim to give tips on how to best structure libraries, production, and delivery to ensure maximum quality.
