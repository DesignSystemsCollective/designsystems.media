Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Torrey Podmajersky
President, Catbird Content
(Day 1/2, talk 05)

TALK: PATTERN-BASED TEXT: INCREASE USABILITY AND REDUCE COST
Everybody can write, and AI makes us faster than ever! But does it make the product work better? Torrey provides practical methods to make every word audition to be in the UI – speeding onboarding, increasing engagement, and reducing support costs. You’ll take away:

- Patterns to make UI more effective—even error messages
- Methods to use generative AI and pattern-created text that will speed up your process
- A way out of unproductive meetings about product content

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
