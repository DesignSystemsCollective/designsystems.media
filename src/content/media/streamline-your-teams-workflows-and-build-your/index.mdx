Our team has been focused on providing the foundation for helping design system teams collaborate seamlessly. We know how important it is for you to control what’s released to your consumers, and we’re excited to introduce Workflows, Selective Publishing, Invite-Only Design Systems and more!

🤝 Collaborate Without Compromise:
Work privately on content and communicate progress clearly with Drafts and Page Statuses. Control what goes live with Selective Publishing, ensuring only finalized content is published.

📊 Standardize Your Content Approval Process:
Define who approves changes before publication with custom Approval Processes, and allow contributions without granting publishing rights through the Contributor Role.

🔒 Keep Precision and Control with Granular Permissions:
Restrict access to specific team members and collaborators with Invite-Only Design Systems. Assign tailored roles using Design System Level Roles.
