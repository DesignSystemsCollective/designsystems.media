Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
David Darnes
Developer Advocate, zeroheight
(Day 1/2, talk 08)

Talk: 
Web Components are a way for us to enrich standard HTML with new behaviors, by creating our own custom elements! Join Dave as he shares his past experience of creating complex design systems, as well as custom open-source tools, all with the power of Web Components. 

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
