DesignOps Island Discs is a live-recorded, interactive podcast from @zeroheight looking at what's coming up in the world of designops and design systems. For season three, we're focussing on the roles that make up designops and design systems, from content designers to leads to engineers to accessibility specialists to DPMs.

For our first episode, we welcome Arielle Benedek, one of the Product Managers on Encore, Spotify's design system, on what a product manager on a design system actually does, what the biggest challenges are, how we need to change what we do, and answers a whole bunch of interesting questions from the live audience.
