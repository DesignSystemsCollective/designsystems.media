⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

"Always Bet on Web Components!" In this episode, we cover the future of the Web development based on Web Components. From a design system perspective to static site generation (SSG), Web Components can and should be everywhere!

We also talk about Rocket, the server side rendering (SSR) toolkit to build static site using Web Components, and we start a new starter kit for Backlight, based on the Lit framework!
