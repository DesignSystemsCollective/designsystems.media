⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

This week we're welcoming Brittney Postma (@BrittneyPostma) on the show! We're going through the Svelte Ecosystem and the Sveltekit project, integrating a Backlight made Design System in it!

We discuss about the compiler and the logics behind Svelte Components. We also do styling improvements, to finally use the simple components coming from the Design System in a live Sveltekit app.

The show is also the occasion to cover the support of MDX in Svelte with the mdsvex project, and to introduce the Svelte Sirens community!
