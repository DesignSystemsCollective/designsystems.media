Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Natalie Hernandez
Senior Content Designer, Nordstrom
(Day 2/2, talk 02)

TALK: BEYOND DOCUMENTATION: SCALE YOUR DESIGN SYSTEM THROUGH CONTENT INTEGRATION
Design systems are often viewed as the domain of UX design and engineering. Designers craft well-rounded, accessible components that engineers then build. Designers and engineers also outline props and APIs, document usage guidelines, develop token naming conventions, and more. But design systems are supposed to be a product—so, how about we treat them that way by assigning content experts? Stop the madness of designers and engineers taking on secondary roles outside their area of expertise, leading to team inefficiencies and crankiness.

In this session, Natalie will discuss the benefits of integrating content within design systems. Drawing from her own experience, she’ll illustrate how dedicated content support allows each discipline to excel, enhances the overall user experience, and ultimately sets design system teams up for greater success.


CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
