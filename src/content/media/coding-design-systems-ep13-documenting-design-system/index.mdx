⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

In this episode, we scratch the surface of writing good documentation for your design system. Successful metrics, discoverability, searching, references, architecture, etc. We also discuss the best practices and how to nudge your people to work on and with your documentation using custom components dedicated to your documentation pages.

We go through documentation of open source design system projects like Bootstrap, Boosted, Tailwind, and the ‹div›RIOTS' dockit-core framework.
