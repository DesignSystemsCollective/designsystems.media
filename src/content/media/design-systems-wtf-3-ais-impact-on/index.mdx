How will AI impact the way we build design systems?

We genuinely can’t believe it’s taken us three episodes to mention AI… It’s obviously a hot topic at the moment, as folks are figuring out how they can use things like GPT or Dall-e to automate or generate things within their design systems, or heck, if they even should use AI in the first place because of the ethical, legal and moral risks!

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question around design system troubles every two weeks.
