Building a Global Design System: How the heck would we even do it?

We dive into the ambitious idea proposed by Brad Frost: creating a global design system for everyone to use. Imagine a world where companies don’t reinvent the wheel with every component they create, but instead, contribute to and utilize a shared set of resources. We tackle the big questions: Where do we start in building such a universal system? How do we address hesitations and resistance in the community? What are the potential risks and unseen challenges? 

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
