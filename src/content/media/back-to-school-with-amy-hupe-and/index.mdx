Is there really such a thing as an accessible design system component? How can the systems team ensure accessible products? Geri and Amy turn the colour contrast up to 11:1 in their final podcast on accessibility.

In this series, Amy and Geri put aside their vocal and opinionated assumptions to dive deep on design systems topics; from Figma libraries to design tokens to deciding if AI can really write decent documentation. Climb aboard the school bus for a field trip on the history, the conversations and the foundations that really make a design system great.
