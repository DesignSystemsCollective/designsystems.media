Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Amy Hupe
Design systems consultant, Frankly
(Day 1/2, talk 05)

TALK: PERFECT PIXEL WHATEVER
Our collective ability to build sophisticated systems that deliver efficiency, scalability and precision has never been better. But services are still failing users in significant but avoidable ways. So what are we missing? How can we go beyond the edges of our design systems to push for human-centered experiences that meet real-world needs?

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
