Synopsis:
Design teams are supposed to be scrappy! Everyone pitch in! Empathy for the other roles on your team! All of these are things I’ve preached and taught, but when is enough enough? In this talk, design system coach Dan Mall show you how to draw firm lines around your design system job so you can stand strong. You’ll learn why the most important word in a design system practice isn’t “component” or “token”; it’s “no”—and how to deal with when others can’t deal with that.
