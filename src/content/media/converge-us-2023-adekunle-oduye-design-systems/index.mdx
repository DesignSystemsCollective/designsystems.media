Converge is zeroheight’s one-day design systems conference. On May 18, 2023, we hosted Converge US in San Francisco at the Great Star Theater! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.

Adekunle is a Design Engineer - Tech Lead at Plaid based out of Brooklyn, NY.

The concept of design systems has gained popularity in recent times, and it is widely known by people and organizations alike that they play a crucial role in enhancing the design and development process. But at the moment, design systems need to support multiple products, brands, and color schemes simultaneously, which presents an interesting challenge. As consumer needs continue to change, design systems must also evolve from a rigid framework to a more adaptable and flexible system that can cater to those needs. What approach can we take to ensure that the design system we create meets the requirements of today while remaining adaptable to the changing needs and desires of tomorrow?
