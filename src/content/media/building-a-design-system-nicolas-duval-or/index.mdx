Speak at Design Encounters 2017 ðŸ‘‰  http://www.designencountersconf.com/

Designers at BlaBlaCar were spending too much time on pixels and less time on crafting the best experience for their users. You'll learn how they managed to make UI a tiny fraction of the entire work of their designers.

Nicolas (Designer at BlaBlaCar) has the goal to make the interface and the experience of BlaBlaCar as transparent as possible. One of his favorite subjects is to make other designers' workflow as smooth as possible. 

Design Encounters is a conference on the interaction of design and development in the creation process. The first edition took place in Warsaw, Poland on November, 17-18, 2016. 

Design Encounters Conference is brought to you by EL Passion (http://www.elpassion.com/).
