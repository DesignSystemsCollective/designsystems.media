Show notes

~ I quickly fell in love with design and user experience. I kind of left that role and jumped out on my own to explore that opportunity a little bit more.
~ We spend a lot of time with them thinking about education, helping everybody inside the organization understand what a system is, why it's important, and what it means for them.
~ We've done some interesting studies to show, just from an efficiency standpoint, how much of an impact a system can have when it's built well and is being used. The numbers are quite staggering.
~ I think of design systems not as a product, but as a program that has to exist inside an organization. When they're done well, they really become the way we build digital interfaces.
~ Two-thirds of the effort is in writing really good documentation and training people to understand that's where they go to get the answers they need.
~ I've got so many insights from people who are out there in the trenches doing this work on a daily basis. If you have questions or ideas on how this work can be done, or if you just need a community of people who can help support you through difficult times, that's really what this is becoming.
