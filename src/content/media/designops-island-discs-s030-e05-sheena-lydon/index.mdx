DesignOps Island Discs is a live-recorded, interactive podcast, looking at what's coming up in the world of designops and design systems. For season three, we're focussing on the roles that make up designops and design systems, from content designers to leads to engineers to accessibility specialists to DPMs.

For episode 5, we welcome Sheena Lydon, DPM on Design Systems at Wise. We're going to talk to Sheena about being a DPM... what the essential skills for a DPM are, why they're important, both on product and design system teams, and why designops is hands down the best timeline to live in.
