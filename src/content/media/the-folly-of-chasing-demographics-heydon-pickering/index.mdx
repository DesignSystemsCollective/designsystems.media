Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Heydon Pickering, Consultant 
(Day 1/2, talk 04)

TALK: THE FOLLY OF CHASING DEMOGRAPHICS
People with disabilities are different. Not only different from those without disabilities but different from other people with disabilities and even different from other people with the same disabilities. Different experiences, different circumstances, different adaptations, different preferences, different everything. So why do we design for ‘screen reader users’ or ‘keyboard users’, for example, like they’re all the same person? Are there less clumsy (and insulting!) ways to approach inclusion?

CONVERGE 2024

At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
