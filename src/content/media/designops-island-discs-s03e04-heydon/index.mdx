DesignOps Island Discs is a live-recorded, interactive podcast, looking at what's coming up in the world of designops and design systems. For season three, we're focussing on the roles that make up designops and design systems, from content designers to leads to engineers to accessibility specialists to DPMs.

For episode 4, we welcome Heydon Pickering, design and engineering consultant, who has worked with Springer Nature, The Paciello Group, BBC, Smashing Mag, and Bulb. We're going to talk to Heydon about being a front-end engineer on design systems... what the challenges are from an engineering point of view with design systems, what makes a good engineer on design systems, and where we need to be heading.
