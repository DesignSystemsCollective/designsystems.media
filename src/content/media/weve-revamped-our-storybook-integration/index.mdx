Our newest release should make it way easier to use zeroheight with Storybook.

➡️ Connect Storybook to zeroheight once in the styleguide settings.
➡️ Add new stories using the brand-new Storybook block.
➡️ Choose the story to display on a page from the new modal that displays all of your available stories.
➡️ Component previews are now shown in an iframe with controls on the page
