Accessibility means that people with a disability can do what they need to do in a similar amount of time and effort as someone that does not have a disability. It means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed or implemented. 

Alistair Duggin, Head of Accessibility at GDS, explains the importance of accessibility.
