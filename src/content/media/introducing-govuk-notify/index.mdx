GOV.UK Notify helps government service teams send text messages, emails or letters to users.

There are two ways GOV.UK Notify sends notifications. Firstly, through a simple integration with web applications or back office systems, or by using our interface, to upload batches of messages  built or extracted from other systems. You donâ€™t need any technical knowledge to use Notify.
