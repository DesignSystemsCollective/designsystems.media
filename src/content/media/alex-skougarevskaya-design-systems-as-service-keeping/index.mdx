You’ve got a design system, now what? At Atlassian we’ve evolved what it means to create, adopt, and maintain a design system over the past 5 years, from a product for products, to a service for people. In this talk, I'll dig deep into who the consumers of our systems are, and some of the things we've done (some that worked, others that didn't) to meet their needs.

Presented by Alex Skougarevskaya at Clarity 2020, on September 2nd, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
