Is your Design System mature and hard to maintain? In this talk we’ll discuss how web components can help us manage the overhead of a design system — freeing us from the dependencies we have become so accustomed to having. Come with us as we move into a leaner world and build on more primitive/fundamentals of the standardized web.

Presented by Stephanie Rewis & Brandon Ferrua at Clarity 2019, on August 21st, 2019. Ends with an interview with Brad Frost.
