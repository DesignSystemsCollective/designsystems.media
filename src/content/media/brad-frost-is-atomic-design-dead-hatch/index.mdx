10 years after Brad Frost released his Atomic Design theory, he asks himself: does it still make sense to build design systems and components the same way he proposed back then?

In his keynote at Hatch Conference Berlin, he walks us through the history of how we built the web and apps, speaks about the role of AI and the future of content generation.
