Supernova brought to you the DesignOps experts Jose Coronado, Karolina Boremalm, Patrizia Bertini, Farid Sabitov, and Andrew Evans, who talked about collaboration levels between DesignOps practitioners and design systems teams, how design operations can drive greater adoption of design systems, and the ideal collaboration model for a design systems team.

The panel was live-streamed on April 4th, 2022, and we had a fun FigJam board (http://bit.ly/3GiKzxU), still open for you to engage, reflect and contribute.
