In many tutorials about design systems, the process to begin shows a linear, step-by-step recipe — planning and research, then designing, then developing, then distributing, and finally, then maintaining. But does it ever really work that way?

Jina will discuss her thoughts on how we talk about design systems, and reconciling that with the real-world realities of what we really face when we do this work.

Presented by Jina Anne at Clarity 2020, on September 2nd, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
