Connect Claude Code to Figma in 60 seconds. No API key. No MCP. No complex setup.

I built a CLI that talks to Figma Desktop through Chrome DevTools so Claude can design directly in your Figma files using your existing session. No configuration needed.

What you will learn in this tutorial:
→ How to set up the Figma CLI in under a minute
→ How to connect Claude Code to your Figma Desktop app

Why this beats MCP for designers:
✓ No API key needed (uses your existing Figma session)
✓ Free Figma account works
✓ Burns fewer tokens
✓ Faster local connection
