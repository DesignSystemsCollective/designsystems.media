The first ever ConvergeLDN took place on 21st September as part of World Design Systems Week. Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems!

Here is Amy Hupe, discussing design system contribution.

Contribution is considered an essential part of most design systems. Inviting insights and improvements from a design system's community of users is what makes it reliable and representative. So why do so many of us find it so hard to achieve and sustain? Are we going about it all wrong, or is there something more insidious at play here? Amy explains why she thinks design systems contribution is ultimately destined to fail and why - against the odds - we should keep going anyway.
