When designing a government service, it is important to start by learning about the people who will use it. If you don’t understand who they are or what they need from your service, you can’t build the right thing.

Carolyn Williams is from the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

Carolyn speaks about listening to user needs and user feedback, and offers her top tips for running a digital service and getting round obstacles. 

DVLA is a huge organisation running many different services, and is blazing a trail in digital transformation. This video is a starting point for teams about to embark on the same journey.
