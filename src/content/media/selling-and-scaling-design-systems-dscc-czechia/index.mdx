Talk #1: "Building consistency in the world of autonomous teams" by Ondřej Havlíček,
This talk is about how Quadient is dealing with the challenges on their „road to a design system“. A story about the experience with implementing a design system in a large software company whose culture has always been about the great autonomy of the software development teams. It is about building a structure without a budget and without a dedicated team. Can there be some advantages to it?

About Ondřej:
Ondřej fell in love with UX design in 2008. Since 2012 I have been in charge of the UX & Graphics team at GMC Software Technology, later renamed to Quadient. Our software helps companies who need to communicate with their clients. He feels very strongly about the idea of consistency as part of great user experience. They started with a style guide, then a UI pattern library, and finally, they're working on a design system now.
