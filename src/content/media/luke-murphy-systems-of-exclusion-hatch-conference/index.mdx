Luke takes us through both their and other folks' experiences of how our designs create discriminatory spaces, and suggest ways we can look through different lenses to make sure we aren't reinforcing the rubbish parts of our world by accident. It's not our fault as designers when we unintentionally reinforce bad things, but it is our responsibility to ensure that we aren't perpetuating systems of harm.
