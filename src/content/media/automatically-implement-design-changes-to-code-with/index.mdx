This walkthrough by a Supernova Solutions Engineer showcases how to implement design changes seamlessly using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a landing page. 

We demonstrate how to use Figma files, Figma variables, and Token Studio within Supernova to manage design data. By setting up automation pipelines and integration with GitHub repositories, you can efficiently deploy changes and have a streamlined process from design to production.
