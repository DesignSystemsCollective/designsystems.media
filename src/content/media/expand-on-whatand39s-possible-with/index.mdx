Themes are value overrides for your tokens.

With Supernova you can now define an unlimited number of themes, with each theme representing a specific view of your design system.

Themes have various purposes, but the main one is obvious: Different color schemes for your design system, such as light and dark mode.

Learn what else you can do with the new Design Token management üëâ https://www.supernova.io/design-tokens
