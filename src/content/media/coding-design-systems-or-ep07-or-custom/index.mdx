⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

A new episode dedicated to Custom Design System to build your personal brand! We're please to welcome Kaelig (@kaelig), co-chairman of the W3C Design Token Community Group!

Based on the project of reshaping his personal website, we go through the process to start from scratch his very own Design System based on the dedicated Figma files. We cover the Tokens declaration and their use in a component. Then we publish the Design System to the npm registry, to finally import it as a dependency in a Next.js app.

This episode is also an occasion to cover the W3C Design Tokens Community Group activity, and the expectations of the incoming specifiation.
