A practical guide to building accessible forms on the web
Speaker: Kateryna Porshnieva – Front-End Engineer, Independent

Web forms are crucial for user interactions on the web, and to ensure our products provide an inclusive experience for all, we need to build them with accessibility in mind. In this talk, we'll dive into best practices and practical tips for crafting web forms that are accessible and won't leave anyone behind. We'll start by focusing on why accessibility is important, followed by a quick tour of the latest WCAG, HTML, and ARIA standards. Next, we'll delve into the principles of inclusive design and how assistive technology interacts with forms. We'll then discuss common patterns in forms and how to implement them inclusively, along with strategies for managing focus state, navigation and validation – all supported by practical examples in React.

Make it accessible and inclusive, make it great!

Vanessa Guilloteau – Head of Product Design, CANAL+ Group

Accessibility and inclusivity have become key societal issues around the world in the last few years. Social networks and large international groups like GAFAM know how to reach large audiences by offering increasingly inclusive and innovative services. What about other major digital players who do not have the same means but are still convinced that accessibility and inclusivity have become essential? At CANAL+, accessibility has become a pillar of the company's strategy for the next few years, especially for myCANAL, our Live and VOD platform. Because it is available on many devices (mobile, tablet, desktop, TV, video game console) and across various platforms (web, iOS, Android), making myCANAL compatible with all forms of disabilities, and more particularly visual disabilities, remains an incredible challenge we try to meet every day. We would like to share a few initiatives we have worked on over the last 2 years to make video-watching accessible to as many people as possible.
