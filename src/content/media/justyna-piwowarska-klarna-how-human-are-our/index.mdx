Our design systems are built to optimize how we work. They aim to increase the efficiency of our production and the consistency of our products. And yet, design systems fail us in many ways. 
In this talk, we’ll look at the fine art of balancing between making a profit and building something for people. Design systems are, after all, systems like any other: prone to oversimplification and oversight, operating with biases and human shortcomings. Let’s look at how to catch those problems early and embrace the imperfections we work with.
