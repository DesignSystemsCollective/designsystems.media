The first ever ConvergeLDN took place on 21st September as part of World Design Systems Week. Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems!

Here is Inayaili León from GitHub, discussing the API of design teams.

DesignOps is the glue that keeps a design org together, and the connective tissue that links design to other disciplines across the company, and beyond. Even if your company doesn’t have a formal DesignOps team, this work is likely being done by someone.
