Is using a pre-built frontend library realistic?

Today we ask, “Is using a pre-built frontend library realistic?” We look into the pros and cons of leveraging frontend libraries such as MUI, Tailwind, or Ant Design for your design system. Are these libraries a shortcut to success, or do they come with hidden complexities and limitations? Tune in as we dissect the practicality, scalability, and long-term implications of adopting these pre-built solutions for your product.

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
