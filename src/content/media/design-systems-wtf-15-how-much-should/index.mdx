How much should you future-proof your design system?

Design systems should reflect what’s currently in your product, but it’s tempting to future-proof them. After all, getting the system up and running was a lot of work, so what’s the harm in adding a few new things? Future us will thank our past selves, right?

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
