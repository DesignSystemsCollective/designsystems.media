The Supernova command-line interface (CLI) enables you to run specific tasks connected with Supernova from your CI/CD pipelines, from your action triggers (GitHub Actions and similar), or from your command line as well. The Supernova CLI is powered by the Supernova SDK, which allows access to many lower-level operations.

In this video, we walk you through the CLI setup that automatically syncs Tokens Studio through GitHub Actions to Supernova.io when token data changes
