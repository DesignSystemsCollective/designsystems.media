Design systems help scale the brand's visual language, design and technology decisions, and accessibility across the organization's digital experiences. Our delivery teams depend on the design system to help provide what good looks like, and often rely on the design systems team to maintain it, add features, and help throughout the contribution process. But what happens when your design systems team disbands?

Let”s talk about the highs and lows of working on a design system, becoming a user of a minimally supported design system, and returning to the design systems' team a little wiser and hopeful. I'll share a bit about our biggest challenge yet, rebuilding trust with the community while ambitiously rebranding on a new technology.

Takeaways:

- Relate to the personal, emotional rollercoaster, of being on a design systems team
- Learn about features and practices to make your design system more robust and self-sufficient
- Learn what to prioritize to continue creating a design system people want to use

Presented by Donna Vitan at Clarity 2021, on October 29th, 2021. Ends with an interview with Mina Markham.
