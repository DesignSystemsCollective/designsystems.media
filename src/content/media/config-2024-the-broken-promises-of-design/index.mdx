Config 2024: The broken promises of design systems (Cam Worboys, Head of Design, Cash App)

Are design systems living up to their promises? Is our work higher quality, quicker, and more cohesive than ever before? Or are we accidentally drifting into a low-quality, restrictive design process that limits creativity?
In this talk, Cam explores design systems' core promises, identifying where they fall short and exploring ways to improve. Leveraging his experiences at Wise, Beats, and Cash App, Cam will share examples, advice, and stories on creating world-class design systems.

Featuring: Cam Worboys, Head of Design, Cash App
