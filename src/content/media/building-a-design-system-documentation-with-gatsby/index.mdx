Great documentation empowers your users and helps newcomers familiarize themselves with your product/process. Unfortunately, doing documentation right -- and keeping docs current and accurate -- is a lot of work. Design systems, in particular, depend on solid documentation because the entire process is built around consistency, reusability and scalability. If the documentation falls down, the design system is likely to follow. 

Check out the source code (https://github.com/adekunleoduye/design-system-starter) for Adekunle Oduye’s presentation for creating a design system starter for Gatsby + Storybook (https://storybook.js.org/), ideal companions for creating a living documentation system. Writing the docs in MDX with Gatsby means making code the source of truth -- and making writing documentation a part of the development process, rather than an afterthought. When documentation is a living part of your code, it’s front of mind to keep it current. Systemizing the documentation process increases efficiency and productivity, and Adekunle demonstrates a practical path to get it done fast with a Gatsby starter using Gatsby for the code and Storybook for the UI.
