With two decades of experience across design, product, and systems thinking, Matt Bailey thrives at the intersection of design, technology, and change — aligning people, processes, and platforms so good ideas move faster. He’s passionate about helping designers thrive through change, embracing imperfection, staying curious, and using emerging tools like AI to amplify creativity while keeping people at the heart of it all.

At our DSL event, he talked about finding calm in the chaos, embracing imperfection, and remembering that the most human thing we can do is keep learning.
