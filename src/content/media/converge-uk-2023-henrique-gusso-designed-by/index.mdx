Converge is zeroheight’s one-day design systems conference. On September 21st, 2023, we hosted Converge UK in Manchester at the Stoller Hall! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.
