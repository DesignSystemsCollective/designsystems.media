⎯⎯⎯ In this episode ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

00:00 - Intro: welcome Stephanie Eckles
07:53 - Upcoming CSS new features for design systems

⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

In this episode, let's cover upcoming CSS features like _container queries_ or _@layer_ to organize and architect the way you distribute your design system. We also cover different ways to define a component with Nunjucks so you can distribute and reuse them in your static website, allowing to create a design system for your static web content as well!
