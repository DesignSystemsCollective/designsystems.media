When designing for a specific user group, we often tend to generalise, following assumptions, biases and stereotypes. So how do we design effectively to invite a use group and broaden our user base? How do we design for children and teenagers? How do we adjust our content and design for Gen-Z? What should we keep in mind for older adults? And what about people who have to make critical decisions under stress and time pressure?
How should our products adapt for people who are deaf, autistic and neurodivergent?

In this session, Vitaly dives into practical design patterns to design better — and help everyone get their tasks done better and faster. With plenty of real-life examples and UX guidelines that you can apply to your work right away.

About Vitaly Friedman

Vitaly loves beautiful content and does not give up easily. Born in Minsk, Belarus, he studied computer science and mathematics in Germany. While writing algebra proofs and preparing for software engineering at nights in the kitchen, at the same time he discovered passion for typography, interface design and writing. After working as a freelance designer and developer for 6 years, he co-founded Smashing Magazine back in 2006, a leading online magazine for designers and developers. His curiosity drove him from interface design to front-end to performance optimization to accessibility and back to user experience over all the years.

Vitaly is the author, co-author and editor of Smashing books, and a curator of Smashing Conferences. He is creative lead of Smashing Magazine and front-end/UX consultant with the European Parliament and Smashing Media, in Europe and abroad, working with Haufe-Lexware, Axel-Springer and a few other companies.

He also runs Measure UX and Smart Interface Design Patterns, friendly video libraries on UX and design patterns, along with a live UX training for UX and product designers.
