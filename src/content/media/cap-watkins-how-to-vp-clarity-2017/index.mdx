A very common question I get, whether at a conference, on a panel or even from people I work with at BuzzFeed, is what my day-to-day work is like as a VP of Design. Since no one week or day is exactly the same, I've historically had trouble answering this question. No more!

In this talk, I’ll detail a full, actual week of being a VP of Design at BuzzFeed, along with some lessons I’ve learned in my role that I have found to apply broadly to leaders across all levels of an organization.

Presented by Cap Watkins at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017. Ends with an interview with Una Kravets
