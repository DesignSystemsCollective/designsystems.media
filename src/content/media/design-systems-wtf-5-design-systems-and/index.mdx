How accessible can a design system really make a product?

In this episode, we try to uncover the secrets of accessibility and design systems. We ask the pivotal question: How accessible can a design system truly make a product? Are design systems the golden ticket to a more inclusive digital world?

A podcast from zeroheight. Letâ€™s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
