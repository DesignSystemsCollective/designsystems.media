We just unveiled live React components in zeroheight. Now, you can import public NPM packages. Once imported, entered code will automatically render the design. And for styleguide viewers, they can make edits to see how changes in code affect the rendered design (no worries - changes made by styleguide viewers won't change it for everyone!).
