For any government service to be put in front of the public, it has to meet the Digital Service Standard, a set of 18 criteria. One of the criteria is that all new source code is made open and published under an open source licence.

This goes hand in hand with our tenth design principle: make things open: it makes things better.

It encourages good practice, It makes collaboration easier and people can learn from each other. Beyond that,  it improves transparency. 

Anna Shipman, Open Source Lead at the UK’s Government Digital Service, Steve Marshall, Head of Technical Architecture at the Ministry of Justice, and Armin Keyvanloo, a Scala Developer working on HMRC’s Multi-Channel Digital Tax Platform (MDTP) talk about the advantages of coding in the open in government.
