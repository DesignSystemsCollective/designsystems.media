Delivery managers work at the heart of teams. They’re at the core of how teams make decisions and are responsible for creating an environment where people are excited about their work. 
GDS delivery managers protect, empower and motivate teams in order to get stuff done and make a real difference for users. 

Whether helping to set out roadmaps to remove blockers to product iterations, delivery managers apply their skills to new, complex and exciting challenges - from software development to policy teams - across GDS.

Syed Bokhari explains some of the skills you need to succeed as a delivery manager (spoiler: it doesn’t involve delivering food!) and shares why he is passionate about delivery management and GDS’s mission.
