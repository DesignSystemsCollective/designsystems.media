Front end developers at the Government Digital Service (GDS) use a variety of different coding languages to build at scale. 

They’re responsible for writing clean, accessible, evidence-based code that helps millions of people to complete vital tasks on GOV.UK every day. And for keeping the site maintainable and changeable so it continues to meet user needs now and in the future.

Software developers are embedded in multidisciplinary teams with designers, user researchers, content designers, technical architects, product managers and site reliability engineers. Together, they help provide simpler, clearer and faster access to essential information and services to help improve how people interact with government.

People join GDS because they want to be a part of something bigger. As senior front end developer Andy Sellick explains, working at GDS is not about influencing a corporate bottom line - it’s about helping real people to do real things.
