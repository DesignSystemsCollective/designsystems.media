You'll often hear people talk about 'the people bit' of design systems, but in my opinion, this is where most of the work is. Before designing or coding anything, we need to understand the structures, relationships, and personalities around us. Putting in this work early can help with governance, adoption, and contribution later on...and it's never too late to start.

This is a bit of an experiment: a short intro video with thoughts around a topic to hopefully start a conversation. Drop a comment below with your take on the topic or reply on Twitter or other platforms where you'll find me as @hereinthehive!
