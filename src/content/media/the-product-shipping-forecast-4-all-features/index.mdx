Working on a product for any length of time will reveal all the little feature requests and improvements that could delight users, but they very rarely get prioritized over other work. In this episode, Rosie and Rob talk about how their team embraced Small but Mighty features alongside their larger product work and what they’ve learned along the way. What makes a good Small but Mighty feature? Can a feature get too big? And how might other teams adopt this practice?
