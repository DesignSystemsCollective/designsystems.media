You already have amazing design systems with battle-tested components, thorough documentation, and a frictionless developer experience - there's just one small problem: it's web-only. Let's expand our design systems thinking to create a cohesive multi-platform experience that works for customers and creators. In this talk we will explore the environments, ergonomics, and economics of building design systems on multiple platforms.

Presented by Danny Banks at Clarity 2020, on September 4th, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
