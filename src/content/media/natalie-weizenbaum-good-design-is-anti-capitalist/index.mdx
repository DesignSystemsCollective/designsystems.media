A discussion of the way the capitalist context prevents designers from doing their best work. Capitalism demands the extraction of ever-growing profits from the user, which inevitably leads to their exploitation. As designers, we strive to give users agency, but our jobs can demand that we strip it away. How can we advocate for our users' needs when the forces of capital have stacked the deck against them?

Presented by Natalie Weizenbaum at Clarity 2022, on November 11th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Sam Kapila.
