Our Design Systems Journey is a Live Session where a Designer and a Developer meet to talk about their use and understanding of Design Systems. In the end they'll, fortunately, produce a comprehensive mind map covering the Design Systems to help and guide everyone in this realm.

⎯⎯⎯ Episode 4: Documentation ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

In this episode, we talk about the documentation of our Design Systems: how to organise the content, how to contribute, how to help designers and developers to share the responsibility of documenting and setting up the backbone of their docs. We also have a look at the Diátaxis framework and how it could help to build a stronger Design System Documentation.
