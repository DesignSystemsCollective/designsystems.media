Every Tuesday at 4:30PM UTC, join @Georges_Gomes, @m4d_z, and their guests in a new live coding session about design systems, on Backlight.dev!

⎯⎯⎯ In this episode ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

00:00 - Intro: Welcome Jonas Ulrich from kickstartDS
05:38 - kickstartDS, a themable design system foundation to boostrap you very own one
18:10 - Implementing a kickstartDS-based component in your design system
25:52 - Using pre-defined stories from kickstartDS
41:48 - Defining and using tokens in a kickstartDS-based app
56:57 - Outro: discover the kickstartDS ecosystem

⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

An episode dedicated to Design Tokens communication between design files and components libraries, from a development perspective. By using kickstartDS, we follow Jonas in the path of building a white-labelled design system for flexibility.
