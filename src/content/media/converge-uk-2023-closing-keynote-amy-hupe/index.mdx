Converge is zeroheightâ€™s one-day design systems conference. On September 21st, 2023, we hosted Converge UK in Manchester at the Stoller Hall! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.

Amy Hupe (She/Her) Frankly.

Coming to you from the depths of burnout, Amy explores the relationship between design systems and disillusionment. What is it about design systems work in particular that has the power to exhaust us? And is there anything we can do to avoid it?
