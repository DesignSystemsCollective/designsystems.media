Documentation is the how. It communicates the purpose of all these aspects of your design system and how best to apply them.

Documentation can look like:

- On-canvas annotations for components in design files
- Style and component descriptions in Figma
- Naming-structures in a library or codebase
- Written articles and guides
- or dedicated websites and tools
