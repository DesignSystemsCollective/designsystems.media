⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

Helped by the creator of Sidewind, a modern state engine for Webapps, we create a new Backlight's Starter Kit based on Web Components and Sidewind to demo how to expose stateful components from your design system, ready to handle state coming from your top-level app.

In this episode, we make the first steps in defining the basics of state management in stateful components.
