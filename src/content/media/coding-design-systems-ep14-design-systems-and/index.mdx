⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

Keep It Simply Simple: when working on a bunch of web pages, using complex tools may not be mandatory, and you can easily rely on Static Site Generators (SSG) like 11ty. And you may want to use a design system, and youd be right! Developing your components in your design system outside of your final project may be a tedious task when you only have access to templating languages. This is also true when you want to integrate partial hydration and islands architecture.

This is where Slinkity comes on stage. This is what we cover in this episode.
