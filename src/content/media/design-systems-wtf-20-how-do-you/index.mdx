We tackle the fundamental question: “How do you prove the value of design systems?” What kind of metrics work? Why does the math seem so fuzzy? Are there any valid measurements? Based on our experiences and what we’ve seen with other teams, we share our thoughts and hot takes when it comes to advocating and validating your design system efforts.

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
