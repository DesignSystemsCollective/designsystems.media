Did you know that you can build custom dynamic color themes without the use of JavaScript or a CSS preprocessor!? With the magic of CSS Custom Properties, HSL colors, and some calc() fun, you too can create custom theming with no dependencies. In this talk, Una will show you how.

Presented by Una Kravets at Clarity 2020, on September 3rd, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
