Talk #1: Modern patterns in modular software design
Ahmad Nassri, Fractional CTO, Answerable & hashtagpaid

Modular architecture patterns have been around for a long time, longer than some of us have even been alive! The pipe-dream to create a fully modular software system is still alive and strong, so what have we learned over the years and across different practices? And how do teams today adopt a modern view to an age-old problem?

A startup advisor and mentor to entrepreneurs & developers, he founded Tech Masters — a developer community of over 10,000+ members engaging in discussions on technology, careers, and learning.

Talk #2: The evolution of Shopify’s color system
By Kaelig Deloumeau-Prigent, UX Developer, Shopify

In this talk, Kaelig covers a case study in how Shopify uses design tokens as the technical foundations of its color system, scaling it to multiple platforms, and with accessible theming in mind.

About Kaelig
Kaelig is a UX developer on the Polaris design system team at Shopify. In the past, he worked on a variety of design systems for companies such as Salesforce, the Guardian, the BBC, and the Financial Times. In 2016, he started talking about Design Systems Ops, a set of principles freely inspired from the DevOps movement, applied to front-end and design systems.
