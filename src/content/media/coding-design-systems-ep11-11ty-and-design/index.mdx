⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

This week, not that much coding, but a nice and insightful discussion with Zach Leatherman, creator and main maintainer of 11ty (eleventy), the modern static site generator. We talk about static generation, JavaScript ecosystem, Open Source communities, Plugins' API and extensions, and the future of the webpages generation. We also cover the design systems field in the context of using SSG (Static Site Generators) and building reusable components. Our best advice: always bet on Web Components!
