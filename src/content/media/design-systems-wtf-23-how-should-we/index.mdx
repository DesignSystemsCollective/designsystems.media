In this episode, we explore the enigma that is design system versioning. How do we make sense of versioning? How do you sync versions between code, design, and documentation? Maybe it’s easier to ignore versioning; but at what cost? Join us if your mind is already spinning!

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
