How do you design for happiness? How do you design for an app where the most important action happens outside of the app? We'll dive into how different parts of a mobile design system started coming together in an MVP and the way happiness became part of collaboration. 

Presented by Sam Kapila at Clarity 2020, on September 3rd, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
