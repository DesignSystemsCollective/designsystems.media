In our How We Document 2023 report, we noticed the traction design systems teams are gaining in their organization. Teams are growing in size and are no longer just made of designers and developers. In this webinar, our panelists discussed what to consider when growing your design system team, including essential roles for successful design system teams, workarounds for managing without additional roles, and the benefits of growing a design system team.
