Style Guides and Pattern Libraries are great tools for documenting the relationships between code and design, but beautiful docs and consistent UI are only half the battle. Somewhere, behind the scenes, those patterns have to live in our code, and hopefully make life easier for developers. We can go beyond “living” style guides to find tools that encourage and document pattern-making from the ground up, across projects, without adding developer overhead. From Sass maps and Jinja macros, to front-end architecture and style-guide generators — let’s talk about the code patterns that make our UI patterns possible.

Presented by Miriam Suzanne at Clarity 2016, on March 31st, 2016. Ends with an interview with Chris Coyier
