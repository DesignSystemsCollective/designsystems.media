The next component your design system team chooses to take on is crucial. It can have an outsized effect on how well the design system will be received, adopted, and scale into the future. Whether you’re starting, restarting, or reinvigorating your design system, you’ll learn how to be both strategic and tactical with your design system approach.

Presented by Dan Mall at Clarity 2022, on November 10th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Jeremy Keith.
