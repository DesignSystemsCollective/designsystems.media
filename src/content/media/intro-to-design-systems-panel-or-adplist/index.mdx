About the Speakers

Bob Sampson started in this industry in 2000 as a Junior Javascript Developer at his first tech company, growing into a Senior Designer by 2013. At Copperleaf as their first Senior Product Designer in 2016 transitioned to a newly created role as DesignOps Lead in 2018.

At Copperleaf drove the task to build a design system from scratch with a dedicated development team, and having it consumed by 12 designers, 100+ developers, and multiple products in a suite. The next step in his careers was starting a new challenge in 2022 at Tangerine Bank as its Design Systems Lead, working alongside a passionate (and growing) design team.

And in 2021 was proud to join ADPList as one of their mentors, hoping to help other designers understands design systems, and talking about being non-neurotypical in your career.

Matthew Talebi has worked across various companies in the Bay Area, including at places like Intuit and Apple, and for the past few years now working in Singapore. When it comes to design systems, Matthew has around five years of experience and has worked to see how we can seamlessly incorporate topics, like accessibility, into a design system.

Some other topics also include growth for designers utilizing a design system, questions such as - how can we ensure our designer have the visual freedom and creativity when a design system has matured?

Matthew also has a lot of front-end web development knowledge, working in hybrid roles in the past as well. This gives him the advantage of being able to communicate and keep designers and developers on the same page as much as possible when building products.

Jennie S. Yip is a hybrid design engineer with a heart for elegant user interfaces, simple user experiences, and beautifully crafted code. She specializes in building scalable design systems and leading multi-disciplinary teams. She collaborates seamlessly with designers and engineers, solving problems in an engineering mindset with a keen eye for design.

With over 17 years of experience, Jennie has worked as a designer and front-end developer for the majority of her career, for a spectrum of tech companies and industries across government, e-commerce, online education, and software. She is currently a Design Architect at Atlassian, crafting a vision and strategy for Atlassian Design System, whilst orchestrating her team through the complexity of design systems at an enterprise scale.

When she is not organizing chaos, you can find her practicing yoga, propagating plants, or contributing to the design systems community in little ways, such as mentoring for ADPList and OOOHours.

Derek Torsani is a designer currently tending to design systems at Plaid, He previously built design systems at Gusto, Oracle, and Alarm.com. After completing his undergraduate degree in Graphic Design at MICA (Maryland Institute College of Art), he went on to work in a variety of design practices, including motion, graphic, web, and product design, before entering the world of design systems full-time.

During his mentorships, Derek enjoys learning just as much from his mentee as he teaches as a mentor. In addition to design, Derek is a musician, painter, and reader.
