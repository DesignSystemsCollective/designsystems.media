This is the third of our webinars surrounding the How We Document report. This time the focus was on Design Tokens. On the 24th May, we had our lead design advocate Luke Murphy alongside special guests, Dan Donald and Kaelig Deloumeau-Prigent, chat about everything tokens! From governance, definition, naming conventions right through to other areas automation could help.

The ‘how we document’ survey was conducted from Sep to Oct 2021 across social media, industry Slack channels and in emails to design system professionals.

Design system documentation has been maturing at a rapid pace over the last five years. how we document is an opportunity for us to stop, reflect and figure out the biggest challenges that face us in how we document and grow our design systems.
