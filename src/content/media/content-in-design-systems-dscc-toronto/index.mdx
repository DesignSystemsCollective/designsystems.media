Talk #1: How Content Graduated From Voice Guidelines to Patterns and Systems
Ryan Bigge, Senior Content Strategist , Shopify

We started with voice and tone guides for copywriters. Then content design patterns emerged. Today, many design systems have embedded content guidelines for each component. Drawing on personal experience, Ryan will discuss how his work as a product content strategist has been shaped by Polaris, Shopify’s design system.

Talk #2: Content for Design Systems: Measuring Success
Jacqui Clydesdale, UX Writer and Content Strategist

“What does success look like?” is something we often ask of content, and the answer can be pretty straightforward for a marketing email or an onboarding flow. But what makes for a good metric for the content in a design system? Drawing on her experience in UX and adult language learning, Jacqui will explore who the users of a design system are, what they need from it, and how writers can develop, test and iterate content to meet everyone’s needs.

About Jacqui
Jacqui Clydesdale is a UX writer and content strategist in Toronto. She has a background in linguistics, English literature and second language teaching, so it’s pretty clear that she loves words. Over the past eight years, she’s developed digital content for Kobo, Canadian Tire, Fast Retailing (Uniqlo), Dick’s Sporting Goods, Shaw, and several startups. She’s agnostic when it comes to the Oxford comma.
