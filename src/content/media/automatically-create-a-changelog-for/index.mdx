We've added a "What's new" block that automatically generates a list of pages that have been added, changed, or deleted. You can show any changes from the last 30 days or since your last release.

This should make it a lot easier to maintain a changelog, create release notes, or keep styleguide viewers up to date on how your documentation is evolving.
