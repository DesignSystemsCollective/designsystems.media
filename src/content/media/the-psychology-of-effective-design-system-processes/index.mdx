Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Marianne Ashton-Booth
Head of Design Systems, ITV
(Day 2/2, talk 04)

TALK: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF EFFECTIVE DESIGN SYSTEM PROCESSES
Design Systems are often an uphill battle, as rewarding as they are they can also be often exhausting and frustrating. In those moments it can be tough to find the positives, but by tuning in through resilience and focus and truly understanding those headwinds and learning how to best utilize those tailwinds to propel you forward.

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
