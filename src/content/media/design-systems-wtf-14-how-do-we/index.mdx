How do we get past the MVP state?—Selling in post-foundation

We examine that critical phase in the life of a design system: moving beyond the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Launching an MVP is just the beginning, but what comes next? We’ll discuss strategies for advocating for more resources, ensuring your work is recognized and adequately resourced, and not just seen as a “free” addition from your team. Drawing from our own experiences and those of other teams, we’ll share practical advice on selling your design system’s ongoing value to stakeholders.

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
