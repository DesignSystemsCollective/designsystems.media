Check out this demo from one of our engineers, Rosie, for help getting started with our new tools for measuring design system adoption.

You can track your design system packages to see which repos are using the latest versions, component usage to see which of your components are being used in code, and non-token color usage to understanding how well your design tokens are being adoptions.

These handy new tools should make it easier to track how your design system is being adopted across the organization.
