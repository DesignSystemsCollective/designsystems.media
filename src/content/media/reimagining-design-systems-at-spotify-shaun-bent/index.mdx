How do you build a design system which supports a fast-paced, autonomous squad culture and works on more than 45 different platforms? How do you govern such a system? How do you handle contributions? Spotify has been on a journey reimagining what a Design System looks like for us. They're still on our journey but have scaled a steep learning curve, made mistakes and occasionally, found great success and weâ€™re ready to share our newly acquired knowledge with the design community.
