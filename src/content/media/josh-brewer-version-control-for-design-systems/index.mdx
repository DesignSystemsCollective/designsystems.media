As teams adopt a Design System-oriented approach to their work, the need for historical visual documentation, file management, and a collaborative workflow becomes obvious. Abstract aims to support a modern design workflow with true version control for design files and specs. Josh will talk about how they use Abstract to design Abstract and help design teams around the world version, share, and collaborate on their Design Systems.
