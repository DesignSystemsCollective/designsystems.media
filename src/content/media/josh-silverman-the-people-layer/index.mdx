The People Layer is the deepest, most complex layer of any organization. It’s a layer of interaction that persists beyond changes in aesthetics, technologies, devices, systems, tools, and trends. Everyone is involved, and everyone can solve for it.

Presented by Josh Silverman at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017. Ends with an interview with Una Kravets
