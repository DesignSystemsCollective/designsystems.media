Working with a design system can be hugely rewarding: layouts can be created and modified using shared components. This should result in faster design and development and consistent designs across the app. But getting there is a slow and painful process. When implementing a design system you have to make many decisions, like: Where do you start? What actually makes a component? And how flexible should components be? This talk will shed some light on these issues by taking you through Deliveroo's process of adopting a design system in its three Android apps.
