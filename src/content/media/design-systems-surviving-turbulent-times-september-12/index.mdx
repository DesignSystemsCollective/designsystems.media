How do design systems and the teams that make them survive during economic uncertainty and the ever-shifting tech landscape? Survival requires more than just luck. It takes strategic prowess, resilience, and advocacy.

Our panelists shared their thoughts and advice on how to survive and thrive in challenging times. We cover topics including how to:
• Navigate budget cuts for tools
• Manage when the design system loses team members (or completely disappears!)
• Leverage your design system documentation to carry teams through
• Advocate for your design system, your team, and your role

Our panelists:
• Mikaila Weaver – Principal Product Designer, Eventbrite; Professor of User Experience Design, University of Southern California
• Davy Fung – Product Design Lead, Design Systems @ Meta; Co-host, Design System Office Hours Podcast
• Michelle Chin (moderator) – Design Advocate, zeroheight; Co-host, UX IRL podcast
