From our How We Document 2023 report, most respondents are in the early stages of design system creation. Starting design systems isn’t just a matter of designing a few components. These days it’s much more than that. Teams are documenting sooner and including tokens earlier.

Learn from our amazing panelists, Lily Dart and Julien Vanière about how they’ve approached starting a design system. When should you start documenting? How soon should you include tokens? What are common mistakes and how can we avoid them?
