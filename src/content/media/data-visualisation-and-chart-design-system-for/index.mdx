Episode 17: Data Visualisation and Chart Design System for Sketch

This week’s pick: Charts for Sketch. A design system made to cover any and all diagram, chart and data visualisation UI patterns. This design system is extremely easy to use and is built with the Atomic design framework in mind. Meaning, you'll have an option to easily maintain this living UX design system document or simply copy-paste the elements you need in your work. This sketch library comes with a lot of cases covered, I couldn't think of anything lacking. Best part? it's free.

Note: we're not affiliated with the tool makers. It's just a great UX tool you should know about.

You can find this design system here: https://www.ls.graphics/charts

In this new weekly UX design, user research and product design tools series I'll share some of the best picks I've encountered to date. You'll find out about the best apps, extensions, websites and other helpful tools.
