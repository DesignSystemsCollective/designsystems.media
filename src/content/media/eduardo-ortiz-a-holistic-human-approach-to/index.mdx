Modern challenges are complex, requiring a systemic approach to problem solving. Solutions that improve lives can only be achieved through a deep understanding of the ecosystems at play, the people affected, the processes involved, and the pain points experienced. The result of this approach is service design that is both nuanced and wide-ranging.

Presented by Eduardo Ortiz at Clarity 2021, on October 27th, 2021. Ends with an interview with Mina Markham.
