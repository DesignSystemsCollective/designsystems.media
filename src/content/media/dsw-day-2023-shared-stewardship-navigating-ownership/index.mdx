In our journey through design systems, it's become clear that for their success and upkeep, contributors need to range from developers to designers, content creators to stakeholders, and many more.

In this talk, I'll share with you the importance of shared stewardship, explore how the concept of ownership can both unite and separate our teams, and we'll uncover how we can cherish each voice and rethink 'ownership' for our teams.
