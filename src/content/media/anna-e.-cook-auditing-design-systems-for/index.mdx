Design systems are a crucial part of building accessible experiences. Each atom, molecule, and organism we create in our systems affects our ability to scale across our product offerings and meet disabled people’s needs. In this session, learn how to audit components for accessibility issues from design to code using plugins, best practices, and testing tools. Walk away from this session empowered to make your design systems accessible sooner!

Presented by Anna Cook at Clarity 2022, on November 10th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Jeremy Keith.
