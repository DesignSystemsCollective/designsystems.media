You've heard about accessibility, and people keep talking about making products more inclusive. But what does that mean? Why does it matter? And how do you do it? Can design systems help? In this talk, we’ll go beyond simple color contrast to understand foundational accessibility and inclusion principles. You’ll leave with concrete steps you can take to make your products more accessible and inclusive without dedicated resources.

Presented by Alison Shaw at Clarity 2020, on September 2nd, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
