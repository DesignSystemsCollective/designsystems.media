About the talk:
Today, nearly every company is trying to create or evolve their own design language system. Often, the goal is to enable designers to create consistently meaningful user experiences. Usually, decisions have already been made in the system before the designers commence working on them, leaving them to question their unique role in the world of design systems.

When designers are not spending time rehashing colours and fonts, how can they anticipate and educate themselves in new skills and frameworks that will be required of them?

In this talk, you will take away best practices for creating and adopting a design language system, as well as key ideas for enabling your company to prepare its' designers for the future.
