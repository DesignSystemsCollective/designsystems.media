Vancouver Javascript Meetup - Halloween Edition.

Projecting and implementing a Design System can be challenging. One of the main questions is: How can we ensure that the Design System will positively impact the user experience? This talk proposes to answer this question through a reflection in dialogue with the ideas of a Doctor in Pedagogy about Information and Knowledge of Experience to achieve the next level of maturity for Design Systems.

Gustavo Teodoro is a Staff Front-End Engineer at Thinkific. Passionate about Design Systems, User Experience and Web Accessibility.
