Talk #1: "Communication between designers and developers, the infinite loop." by James Malone, Design Director at NearForm

Design systems include documentation for many things like colours, content and principals. Collaboration and internal communication however are often not part of this process, but they should be. Drawing on personal experience, James will discuss how to plan and think about collaboration from the start.

About James
James Malone is the design director at NearForm with over two decades of design experience. James has worked in a multitude of industries managing small and large design teams. James is passionate about Design Operations, improving efficiency through collaboration, and dismantling the fabled gap between design and development.

Talk #2: "Breaking down silos, automation, workflows, tools and humans." by Stuart Giles, Senior Product Designer at NearForm

Design systems are built to meet the bespoke requirements of a company, team or organisation. Each one is different and unique. In a similar way, the teams that use these systems are unique and different too. Stuart looks at how to break down silos and create tools, workflows and processes that are customised to the unique users who use them.

About Stuart
Stuart is a Senior Product Designer at NearForm where he works with large household brands to implement, scale and automate design systems. As a lead product designer he defines the experience of digital products through research, design, and development phases. Stuart is as happy in Sketch as he is at a command line and jumps between the two seamlessly.
