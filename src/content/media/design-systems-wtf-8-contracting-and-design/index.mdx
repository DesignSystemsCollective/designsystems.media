Can you create a successful design system by contracting work out?

We explore the dynamics of working with external design teams, freelancers, or agencies to build a cohesive design system. Is it a recipe for success, or does it present unique challenges that could impact the system’s effectiveness? Join us as we uncover the pros and cons of this approach and share insights on navigating the path to a thriving design system.

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
