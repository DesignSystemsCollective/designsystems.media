Navigating design system contributions - how do you tell someone their component is terrible?

In this episode, we address a challenge many design system creators face: Navigating design system contributions and giving constructive feedback. How do you effectively communicate that a contributed component may not meet the standards or expectations (i.e., they’re just plain terrible)? We discuss ways to encourage improvement without demoralizing contributors. Join us as we explore best practices, real-life stories, and strategies for fostering collaboration and quality within your design system.

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
