A digital service has been developed to allow visitors to the UK to apply for a visa online.

Home Office user researcher Katy Arnold talks about her team's recent visit to China to understand at first hand the experience of Chinese holiday visa applicants to the UK. 

The service is now live on GOV.UK:
