Talk #1: Design Systems on a Rocket Ship
Diogo Ramos, Senior Product Designer, League

So everyone at your company understands the value of a design system and you think you got buy-in to build one. But did you? For small, fast-moving teams, this kind of initiative can, at times, be seen as too much of an effort and cost. Resources that are being spent on design systems aren’t being spent on building features for the product. So how can your company have their cake and eat it too? This talk will explore strategies that will help you get support and grow a design system when challenges arise.

About Diogo
Diogo is a product designer living and working in Toronto. He is currently a Senior Product Designer at League on a mission to help people live better, healthier lives through thoughtful design. He’s also spearheading League’s design system, Genesis. Outside of design Diogo drinks a lot of coffee and plays a lot of soccer, but he also loves architecture, dogs, movies and music. He lived in 4 different countries and his favorite animal is an Otter.

Talk #2: Launching a Lean Design System
Jake Janosik, Manager Product Design, Snaptravel
Mostafa Elhefnawy, Sr. Product Manager, Snaptravel

What happens when you work for a small startup and your design system needs to launch while making new features and not holding up growth? We will explore how we approached building a lean and mean design system, what we learned during build and launch, and where we are today because of it.

About Jake
Jake is a product designer from Toronto, currently leading and managing the design team at Snaptravel, where he owned the creation of their design system, Atlas. He previously worked at several agencies in Toronto, advising and designing for startups and working inside enterprise companies making impactful products. Outside of work, you can find him in a coffee shop daydreaming, attending loud concerts or hiking around the world.

About Mostafa
Mostafa has been in product throughout his whole career both as an individual contributing product manager and as someone that built out and managed a product team. He’s worked on a range of different types of products/businesses such as SaaS, Marketplaces, E-commerce, Native Apps, Web, and Chatbots. Throughout each of his roles, he’s had a very close relationship with the Design team which gave him first-hand exposure to some of the problems that a product and design team faces in the absence of a design system
