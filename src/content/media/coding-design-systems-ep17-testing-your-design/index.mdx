⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

Testing might be impressive, but it shouldn't. Thanks to his vast experience in scaling software architectures and front-ends, Gil Tayar is guiding us through the fantastic field of components testing. A vision of how to design systems help you to be more confident in your final product, by testing their components, from unit tests to visual regressions.
