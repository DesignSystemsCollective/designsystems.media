How do you reward someone for the contributions they make?

From the big questions straight into the weeds! This has been a favourite question in the last few years of figuring out how to rightly reward folks for contributing, but also how to motivate them to contribute in the first place. Are shout-outs enough? Do we need to tie rewards to the wider company rewards? Should motivation to contribute be intrinsic or extrinsic? Should we be encouraging contributions at all?

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
