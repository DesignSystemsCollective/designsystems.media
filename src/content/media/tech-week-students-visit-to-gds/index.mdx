On Friday 8 July 2016, a group of A Level students were invited to visit the Government Digital Service as part of GDSâ€™ support for Tech Partnership Tech Week. During the day, the students built Arduino robots in a hands-on programming workshop and visited the GOV.UK, Standards Assurance, Services, Platform as a Service and Verify teams within GDS, as well as finding out about digital apprenticeships and the civil service fast stream scheme.
