In this 25-minute talk, Hector discusses speculative design as a potentially useful framework for thinking about how design systems may evolve in the future. An overview of futures thinking and systems thinking is presented, followed by examples of design provocations and fictions revolving around a future vision for design systems.

Note: Discussing Generative AI is strictly for brainstorming and speculation. It is based on Hector’s personal thoughts based on industry trends, and doesn’t represent Pinterest’s views on Generative AI.
