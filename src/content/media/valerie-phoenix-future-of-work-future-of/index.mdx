The role of ethics in technical management is more important than ever. As the future of work changes, so will our leadership skills. During this session, Valerie Phoenix will take her experiences as an engineering manager and Executive Director of Tech by Choice to explain how emotional intelligence, DEI-centered workplace policies, and coaching can help us deal with the rebirth of the workplace.

Presented by Valerie Phoenix at Clarity 2022, on November 10th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Jeremy Keith.
