Design Systems. We always talk about the user interface. But the true power (and challenges) of design system lie outside over components and icons.

The ability to join together an organisation and create an ecosystem for product design.

We were joined on June the 6th by Alex Chan Perryman Design Systems Manager at Deel, Romit Soley a Senior Product Designer who recently redesigned a design system for PubMac and Harisson Cochrane a UX Designer who has worked with building ownership of design systems in his work.

Over an hour we talked through building a business case for design systems, exploring how to show ROI, the who and what of design system ownership and how everything NOT UI like content writing, documentation, and brand playbooks fit the picture.
