It's time for another Design Systems Community Meetup of the Berlin Chapter! We are excited to run an amazing GitHub-flavoured event this time.

SYSTEM FOR HUMANS - PRACTICES TO ENCOURAGE ADOPTION, COLLABORATION, AND CONTRIBUTION
Ash Guillaume, Systems Designer at GitHub

"Design systems go beyond component libraries and guidelines, they also include the team that utilizes the system resources on a daily basis. I want to share how my team and I have created a collaborative and safe environment for designers to work smarter and be happier when using our design system."

THE ART OF BEING REPLACEABLE IN DESIGN SYSTEMS
Au, Senior Systems Designer at GitHub

Using principles of systems theory, design principles and design culture best practices I want to demonstrate that great design systems can be timeless. That they can scale and take on any challenges the future may hold. This is a talk about design culture and soft skill but with a focus on practical examples of how that translates into design decisions and methods.

The meetup is remote and hosted by the Design System Community Chapter Berlin!

We're looking forward to seeing you!
