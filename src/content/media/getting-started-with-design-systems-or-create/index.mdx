Episode 1: Getting Started with Design Systems

Note: apologies for potato sound quality... microphones are still tricky to get right.

This video will kickstart the new mini-tutorial series on creating your own design system using Sketch app. I’ll walk you through key steps, caveats, pros and cons to making a design system and more.

A design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer’s friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organizations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles.
