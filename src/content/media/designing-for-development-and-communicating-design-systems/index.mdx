Talk 1: Communicating design systems - Viktoriia Leontieva (Senior product designer at Github)

On the surface, a design system is a collection of design tokens: color, layout, typography, iconography, etc. but behind each is a series of decisions that shape its current form. The result is a reflection of your teamâ€™s ability to arrive at a simple, single answer in conversations with maintainers and users. This talk is informed by a series of interviews with system designers to get to the bottom of why, and how, communicating your design system is the key to its success.

Talk 2: Designing for Development, building a Design System at Brainly - Patrycja Rozmus (Design system lead at Brainly)

In this talk, Patrycja will introduce the history of the design system and design processes at Brainly, explain the genesis of their homemade design system tooling that became popular worldwide - Html-Sketchapp. She will also dive into the struggles connected to selling design systems to business and present some takeaways that might be useful for other teams.
