Design Systems and Design Operations are often conflated, with good reason. The two are inextricably tied, each building off a mutually beneficial holistic system with the whole greater than the sum of its parts. The symbiotic relationship enables higher-performing teams, a more efficient workflow, and allows companies to better understand design to drive business impact, and directly impact the customer experience.

Presented by Alison Rand at Clarity 2020, on September 4th, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
