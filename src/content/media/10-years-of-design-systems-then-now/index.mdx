Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Madelin Snyder, 
Head of Product, zeroheight 
(Day 1/2, talk 01)

TALK: 10 YEARS OF DESIGN SYSTEMS: THEN, NOW AND WHAT’S NEXT
In this opening keynote, Madelin explores where zeroheight has been and where we’re going next. Plus, she is joined by colleagues Nef and Tim for a mini-panel session. 

CONVERGE 2024

At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
