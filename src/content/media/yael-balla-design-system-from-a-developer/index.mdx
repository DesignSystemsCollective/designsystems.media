Design Systems is something every UX team is working on, planning to work on, or at least is talking about. But what does it mean for a developer to implement a new design system for the company products? Is it also better for the developer? In the talk I will share my experience with implementing a design system. How to share design tokens in the organization? How to create a component library and separate the visual layer from business logic? How do you keep sync between design and code? In this talk I will try to answer these questions, using code examples and relevant tools.
