If I were to boil down my entire strategy for working with #designsystem teams, it’d be this quote from former Intel CEO Andy Grove: “Let chaos reign. Then rein in chaos.”

From a #uidesign standpoint, most teams have let chaos reign for a longtime. The misstep is that, instead of trying to rein in the chaos, they instead try to create a whole new systems that prevents chaos in the first place. That’s an exercise in futility.

When I work with teams, I try to normalize this as a natural cycle. Give people the ability to create chaos. Then spend scheduled, intentional time to rein it in. Rinse and repeat.

In a future post, I’ll describe my favorite technique for doing this: designating a monthly Systems Week.
