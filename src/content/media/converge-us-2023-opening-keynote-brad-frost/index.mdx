Converge is zeroheight’s one-day design systems conference. On May 18, 2023, we hosted Converge US in San Francisco at the Great Star Theater! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.

Our opening keynote was Brad Frost, Principal and Technical Consultant, Big Medium.

Design systems have proven to be an effective tool for helping organizations efficiently create high-quality digital interfaces. Ten years ago, Brad invented a methodology for creating successful design systems called Atomic Design, and has helped scores of organizations on their design system journeys. In this talk, Brad will share success stories, reveal hard lessons learned, and reflect on the past, present, and future of design systems.
