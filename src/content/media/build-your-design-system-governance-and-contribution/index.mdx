Creating a design system contribution model is the best way to create design system governance. This helps create product team alignment for better design handoffs to developers.

Design System Course for Figma

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Design Friends
Building out design systems involves more than just creating the components; it's also about connecting your team and getting team alignment.

The governance model is a framework of four categories that helps you manage contributions to your design system and decide what needs to be added.

The four categories are decision, design, development, and delivery. The governance flow is simple but can be customized to fit your team's needs. 

Billy unpacks the categories with examples and shows you how to adjust as you work through the template.

With this template, you can educate new team members on building their individual processes and understand how to contribute to the design system. If you want to improve your design system process and align your team, download the free template available on Figma Community.
