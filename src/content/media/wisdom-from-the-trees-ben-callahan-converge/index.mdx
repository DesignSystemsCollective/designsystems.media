Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Ben Callahan, 
Founder, Sparkbox 
(Day 1/2, talk 02)

TALK: WISDOM FROM THE TREES
Design system work is as much about the space between the components as it is about the components themselves. In this presentation, Ben shares learnings from his experience hosting The Question, a weekly collaborative learning conversation where the design system community answers a very specific question and dives into the data together. This presentation weaves the narrative of the coastal redwood trees together with the power of language and classic systems thinking. The result is an edifying realization of the impact a system can have when we remember that we need each other to move our industry forward in a sustainable way.

CONVERGE 2024:
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
