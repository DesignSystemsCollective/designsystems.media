The Government Digital Service (GDS) talks…how to start a career in tech.

According to a Tech Nation Talent report, young people could be wrongly counting themselves out of a fulfilling career because they’re worried about things like their skills background, where they came from or their lack of “network”. 

We don’t want anyone to miss out on a great career in digital, data or technology. Because diverse teams that reflect the society they serve are more effective and better to be a part of (and those are the types of teams we’re trying to build).

We asked 3 of our developers to respond to the report’s findings, and hopefully put some of those myths and misconceptions to bed.

Rosa, Iqbal and Kelvin share their own experiences and talk about the different roles and disciplines you can work in. They also share practical tips and advice on how to get started in the tech community - whatever your background or starting point.
