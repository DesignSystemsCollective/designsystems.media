In this talk, Adrián Bolonio, Senior Accessibility Software Engineer at Miro, dives into how Design Systems can enhance accessibility in digital products. He shares key insights on integrating accessibility from the start, using flexible design tokens, and debunks the myth that accessibility is a simple checklist. Adrián’s advice will help you make your design system truly inclusive.
