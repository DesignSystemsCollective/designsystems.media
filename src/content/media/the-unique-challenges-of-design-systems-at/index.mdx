Jen Witkowski, Associate Design Director @lullabot presents "The Unique Challenges of Design Systems at Scale" at ColorCode: Buffalo 2025.

Setting up a design system can help create consistency and guardrails for authors, designers, strategists, developers, and all involved in creating and maintaining websites or applications.

But what happens when that design system needs to expand to support numerous applications and websites, each with a different purpose and audience?

In this session, we’ll share some design challenges we’ve encountered when working with large design systems that need to scale. We’ll discus:

– scaling and maintaining design patterns
– naming systems at scale
– maintaining a “system of systems.”
– governance and adoption at scale
– component content flexibility and guidance at scale

This session is for designers who are already familiar with design systems but unsure how to scale them to multiple websites and applications.

NOTE: Sorry about the audio quality, we made the wrong microphone / audio decision for this presentation.
