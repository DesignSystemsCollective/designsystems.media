👩🏻‍💻 Architecting CSS grid in a design system
CSS grid has been supported by major browsers since 2017 and based on the State of CSS survey, it is a fairly well known CSS property. In this talk, I'd like to share the thought process and exploration of how CSS grid can be used in a design system meant to be used by a wide audience.

About Chen Hui Jing @huijing

My name is Chen Hui Jing. I first dipped my toe into the waters of web development when I built my first HTML website in 2008 for the Malaysia Basketball Association.

From there, I discovered the existence of content management systems and migrated the site over to Drupal. I stopped working on the site a year later and put my web development journey on hold (the original site no longer exists either).

After a 4-year sabbatical (from web development), I decided to restart this journey by diving in head-first this time. In September 2013, I got a job in the web industry and this website chronicles my experiences as I learn new things, fail spectacularly and make cool stuff along the way.

I also founded Talk.CSS, a meetup around all things CSS, with Chris Lienert, and ran it with my best mate, Gao Wei after Chris returned to Australia.

The idea for Talk.CSS was born on the Kopi.JS slack channel on October 26, 2015 and within 2 hours, we had a logo, a Gitter channel, a Meetup.com account, a venue for the meetup and a couple speakers. Colour us efficient.

I also have a day job as a Frontend Developer at Shopify, because we all need to pay the bills.

Designers and developers share a common mission - to create amazing experiences. But it's not always easy for these two tribes to communicate. To bridge the gap between design and technology, we created the Front Conference in 2011.

To create great digital products, we rely on each other: designers on developers and developers on designers. That's why we came up with the idea of a conference for everyone involved in the design and implementation of a front end.

By staying at the forefront of both design and technology, we've grown to become the largest web conference in Switzerland. Our interests have broadened to reflect the increasing maturity of the industry. We now cover management topics such as design leadership, tech governance and UX strategy.

Our attendees range from juniors to managers, and we attract key speakers to come to Zurich and share their knowledge in talks and workshops.

The conference has become a place to learn and network, and we have many loyal professionals who come back every year.
