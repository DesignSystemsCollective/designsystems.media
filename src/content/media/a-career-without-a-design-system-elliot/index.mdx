Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Elliot Jay Stocks
Author, Univeral Principles of Typography
(Day 2/2, talk 06)

TALK: A CAREER WITHOUT A DESIGN SYSTEM
Do passion projects lead to paying work? Can creative fulfillment sit alongside commercial failure? Is it possible to be successful without a plan? In this talk, Elliot designs a system in reverse, looking back at the messy paths that have led him to interesting places in his career.

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
