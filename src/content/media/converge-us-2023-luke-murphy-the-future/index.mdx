Converge is zeroheight’s one-day design systems conference. On May 18, 2023, we hosted Converge US in San Francisco at the Great Star Theater! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.

Luke is a Lead Design Advocate at zeroheight, and based out of London, UK.

Tim Berners-Lee has a lot to answer for. Before the World Wide Web, academics were building hypertext systems that instead of being linear, unidirectional and constantly broken, that have been all but forgotten. Imagine a world where our documentation, instead of being relatively static and linear, was structured into knowledge graphs – with each small chunk inextricably linked to everything it’s related to. Where links are contextual and speak to each other. And where we can start building our documentation in the same way we build our design systems - systemitized, efficient and structured. Luke will take us through the wonderful world of structured content, and how we can start rethinking the way we document our design systems to make all our lives easier.
