Services are assessed to make sure they meet the Digital Service Standard and to protect the quality of GOV.UK. 

The assessment is run by a panel of experts from either GDS or your departmental assessment team. Panels are normally made up of 4 or 5 assessors, including a lead assessor, a user researcher, a designer and a technical lead.

Some departments run internal assessments slightly differently. Check with your departmentâ€™s assessment lead to find out exactly what will happen at the session.
