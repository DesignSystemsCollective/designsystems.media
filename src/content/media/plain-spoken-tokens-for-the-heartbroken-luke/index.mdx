Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Luke Finch
Design systems consultant
(Day 2/2, talk 07)

TALK: PLAIN SPOKEN TOKENS FOR THE HEARTBROKEN
Knowing where to begin with design tokens is tough. This talk will guide you through strategies to tackle overwhelming token systems, the art of logical abstractions, and tips and tricks to set you up for success with design tokens.

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
