Now hiring: a designer who can ship.

Wanna work for and with me?

I’m looking for someone who can free me up of the tactical digital design work I currently do. I’m a designer who ships stuff, so, in order for you to free me up, you have to be a designer who ships stuff too.

Types of projects I’d put you in charge of (depending on your skillset):

• Create social media graphics
• Design and build landing pages and microsites
• Edit videos
• Set up third-party software & apps
• Marketing + email automations

Compensation: $3k/month for a remote contract position, paid on the 1st of the month. If working together is going well after a few months, I’m open to and expect to increase both the workload and the pay.

Think all this fits you? Get a portfolio together and get ready to apply on Friday when I open up applications. More details at https://danmall.com/posts/now-hiring-a-designer-who-can-ship/
