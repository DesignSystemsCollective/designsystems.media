[00:00:00] Have you considered not releasing global tokens to the wider platform to prevent people from directly using them?
[00:03:38] Was the system consolidation a business requirement or design team initiative?
[00:04:18] How do we measure the coverage of the Design System?
[00:08:49] How do you get developers interested in starting a design system from scratch?
[00:11:25] When making global colour changes where in the hierarchy do you verify everything is still accessible?
[00:12:42] What, if any challenges, did you face when switching the brand colour to orange?
[00:15:35] Do your designers use the same version numbers as the engineers?
[00:16:58] Is there a strategy for versioning?
[00:20:31] Are we creating a situation where we're trying to force a square peg into a round hole, creating problems for everyone with design systems?
[00:21:52] Do you use the Lego analogy to describe Design Systems to stakeholders?
[00:23:03] Could you expand on the culture issues you've come across?
[00:24:42] How does your Design System Council set-up work?
[00:27:58] So working as designers and engineers together, what have you found to be the biggest challenges?
[00:31:58] What has been the most rewarding thing working in Design Systems?
