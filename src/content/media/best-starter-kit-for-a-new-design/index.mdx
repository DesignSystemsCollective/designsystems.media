Episode 37: Best Starter Kit for a New Design System?

This week’s pick: Details design system. A kit that I've used to start scalable and powerful UI and product design systems in an Atomic Design framework for quite some time. Details kit provides a simple yet structured starter for any designer to customise. Better yet, you can download Sketch and/or Figma version of their Atoms (and some of the molecules) for free. It doesn't get better than this, especially if you've been planning to create a decent system for one of your products or services.

Note: we're not affiliated with the tool makers. It's just a great UX tool you should know about.

In this new weekly UX design, user research and product design tools series I'll share some of the best picks I've encountered to date. You'll find out about the best apps, extensions, websites and other helpful tools.
