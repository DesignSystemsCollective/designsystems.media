Processes are just as important as the tools and assets within the system. It’s important to establish these with your contributors before a design system goes live.

They capture the mechanics and governance for managing a design system:

- How to make updates to a system and share them with others
- Who to give feedback to and how
- How to get changes to the system approved
- How to collaborate with cross-functional teams
- How to provide training to new members of the team
- and more
