In this webinar, “What really matters in design systems,” we explore the core elements that make design systems truly impactful. Join our panel of experts from DoorDash, Meta, and GSK as they discuss the mechanics of components, the importance of design decisions, and the shift toward shared systems with agnostic libraries. We also explore the role of specs in analyzing design intent, the evolving career landscape in design and engineering convergence, and the potential of AI in creating accessible design systems. Tune in as we unpack the intricacies of design systems and how they shape the future of digital product development.
