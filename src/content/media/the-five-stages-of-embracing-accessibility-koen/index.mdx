Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Koen de Greef
Design Strategist, Nederlandse Spoorwegen
(Day 1/2, talk 09)

TALK: THE FIVE STAGES OF EMBRACING ACCESSIBILITY
Companies often find that embracing digital accessibility is a journey, much like navigating the five stages of grief. In this talk, Koen explores these stages from a DesignOps perspective. Starting with denial, moving through resistance, and aiming for commitment. He will share examples of challenges you might face and practical ways to overcome them in order to work towards truly accessible design.

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
