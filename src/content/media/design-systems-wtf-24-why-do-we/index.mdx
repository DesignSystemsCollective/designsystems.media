In this episode, we’re focusing on patterns, the often-overlooked pillar of your design system. Why should we focus on patterns more than components? Are your components really as reusable as you think, or are they just static building blocks without a solid pattern to guide them?

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
