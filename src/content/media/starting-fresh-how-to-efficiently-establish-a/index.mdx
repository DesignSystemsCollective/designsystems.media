Title: Starting Fresh: How to Efficiently Establish a Design System from Scratch
Speaker: Augustina Ao Liu

In this presentation, I will take you through the process of building a robust design system from the ground up, using my experience at one startup I worked in as a case study. We will explore the key steps to create a design system that not only ensures consistency across products but also offers the flexibility and scalability needed to grow with the organization. I'll also cover some tips and myths during this process. Whether youâ€™re working in a small team or a large organization, this talk will provide actionable insights into creating a foundation that supports both present and future design needs.
