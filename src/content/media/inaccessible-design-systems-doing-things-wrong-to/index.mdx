Creating effective design systems is a challenge, and making them accessible adds another layer of complexity. In this talk, we will explore the obstacles and opportunities of building inclusive design systems that thrive. Drawing on our experience creating the Chameleon Design System at GoTo, we will examine the typical stages companies go through when embracing inclusive design and share examples of past failures and lessons learned. By the end of the talk, attendees will have gained insights into how to avoid common pitfalls and create successful, accessible design systems that prioritize empathy and passion over perfectionism. 

Join Wendy on this journey towards more inclusive and effective design!
