This month, Michelle is joined by two new faces: Tim Legierse, one of the most tenured members of the zeroheight team, and Beau Ulrey, Sr. Design System Manager at U.S. Bank. This month’s discussion is about how design systems can foster user trust. Sure, a good set of reusable components can create a more consistent product. But what does that mean for users? According to the folks at U.S. Bank, a more consistent UI is a key driver for user trust and adoption, and they’ll tell us how.
