Taiste Talks is a video and podcast series where we discuss the world of design and technology from the perspective of our everyday professional lives.

In this episode, we tackle a very timely topic: design systems. To some degree, almost every company would benefit from having one. Building a design system that is actually useful requires a lot of back and forth between developers and designers – and combining these different approaches is not always easy.

Joining us in the studio, we have UX Designers Joona Viljanen and Jussi Peso, as well as Software Developer Tero Parvinen. They share a long history with working on design systems – and a very similar sense of dry wit.
