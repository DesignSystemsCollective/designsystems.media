Design systems help us work more efficiently by helping us to accelerate and multiply our design decisions across our product landscape.

But design systems are not just harmless scaling machines.

When we don’t design for the full human spectrum of identities and characteristics and circumstances and experiences that our design system needs to serve, we don’t just exclude people - we erase them.

In this talk, Amy will explore the human side of design systems, and how we can create more conscious design systems that centre people over technology.
