Should I use tokens today?

DESIGN TOKENS. The saviour of our design systems, or so it seems from the amount that people hold them up as the shining light. But what’s the deal with design tokens — when do they make sense for your company? What is going to happen to them in the future? And who do you listen to when it comes to doing them correctly?

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
