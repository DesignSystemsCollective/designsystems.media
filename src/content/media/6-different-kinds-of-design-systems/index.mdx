Can you name 6 different kinds of design systems? Here are the ones I’ve identified in my work:

1. Brand identity/design language as design systems
2. Tools as design systems
3. Products as design systems
4. Process as design systems
5. Design systems as a service
6. Design systems as a product

For more details and examples of each, watch my full YouTube video: “What is a Design System? 6 Different Types of Design Systems:” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMSSg-pA9lk
