When you look behind the curtain of your design system, what do you see? Documented components, accessible guidelines, manual processes, a shifting roadmap? When this becomes the status quo, it can trap your system in an endless cycle of maintenance. And that’s not fun for anyone. In this talk we’ll share the challenges Netflix has faced as we break away from this cycle, how we’ve modernized our approach to building at scale across Web, Mobile, and TV, and what this can unlock for you.
