So you’ve gotten buy-in, you’ve made an inventory of designs and components, and you’ve set up your team’s first design system. What happens next? This talk will explore maintaining a design system, as well as new challenges that arise once your design system matures. Topics that this talk will cover will include: documentation, adoption, support, tooling, and architecture.

Presented by Isha Kasliwal at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017. Ends with an interview with Una Kravets
