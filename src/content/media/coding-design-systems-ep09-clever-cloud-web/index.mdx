⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

"Always bet on Web Components." Clever Cloud team choose to rely on the Web Components technology to build its console UI. Hubert is their core maintainer and in this episode, we talk about how they built them, how they customize them, and how they ship them. Because they build a Smart CDN to pre-pack the collection and distribute it, we also cover the pack-as-a-service aspect of distributing such a collection.
