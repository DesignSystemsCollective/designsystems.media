In this episode, we navigate the challenges and uncertainties that arise when a design system team undergoes downsizing or restructuring. How do the design system team and teams who use the design system cope in this situation? We explore strategies for resilience, collaboration, and innovation in the face of adversity and discover how to thrive amidst organizational changes.

A podcast from zeroheight. Letâ€™s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
