Partly based on an article I wrote earlier in the year, I wanted to encourage people to document early in their process. Get people used to there being one place to find out about everything, including the current state of the site or app.

This is a bit of an experiment: a short intro video with thoughts around a topic to hopefully start a conversation. Drop a comment below with your take on the topic or reply on Twitter or other platforms where you'll find me as @hereinthehive!
