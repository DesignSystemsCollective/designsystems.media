While in the weeds of a design project, it’s easy to lose track of an overall objective. Especially if you’re only responsible for a small piece of that objective. But design should always come from a perspective. Usually that perspective is developed at the origin of the brand. In this session, Ben will go through the process of developing a brand perspective, and how that can affect design decisions down the road.

Presented by Ben Colar at Clarity 2020, on September 2nd, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
