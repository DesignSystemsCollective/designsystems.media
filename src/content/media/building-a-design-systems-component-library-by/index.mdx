A component library attempts to translate the principles and designs of a design system into reusable code.

Typical goals include building a library that is future-proof, low-
budget in development and maintenance, while providing a large set of
usable components, and achieving a great developer experience and
consistency in design and UX for its users.

In this talk we will look at how we aim to achieve these goals using
modern techniques such as design tokens and web components, and
automating as much as possible.
