DesignOps Island Discs is a live-recorded, interactive podcast, looking at what's coming up in the world of designops and design systems. For season three, we're focussing on the roles that make up designops and design systems, from content designers to leads to engineers to accessibility specialists to DPMs.

For episode three, we welcome (back) Amy Hupe! Amy is a content specialist and design system consultant, having worked on design systems from Springer Nature, to BT, to Babylon Health, to Gov.uk. Luke and Amy chat about what a content specialist actually does, why they're the essential third pillar of a design system, what makes a good design system content person, and some of the things that are exciting Amy about the future of content design in design systems (hello structured content), before answering super interesting questions from the live audience!
