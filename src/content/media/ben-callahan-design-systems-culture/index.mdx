The culture around your design system is greatly impacted by the culture of your organization. In this presentation, Ben will share how this understanding will impact the way you approach creating a sustainable systematic design practice. We'll examine the various types of organizational cultures and consider how they work together (and how they don't). The hardest work we have to do is the cultural work. This presentation will help you face that challenge head-on and shape your approach, making things more likely to succeed.

Presented by Ben Callahan at Clarity 2022, on November 11th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Jeremy Keith.
