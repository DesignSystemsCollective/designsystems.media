Check out the exclusive recording from Supernova's first Design System Happy Hour, hosted in Prague ðŸš€ðŸ’¡

The star of the night was Laura Fehre (Design Systems Manager at Mews, previously Mobile Design System Lead at HelloFresh) who took us on a journey from her roots as an individual contributor to team leader and spilled the beans on how AI rocks the design world every day. Plus, she gave us the essential traits of building a great design system team. 

It was a night of learning, making new friends, and getting inspired in the design world!
