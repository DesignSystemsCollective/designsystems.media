## [Amy Hupe: ‚ÄúDown with Design Systems Dogma‚Äù ‚Äî¬†Clarity 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYecMG00XXs)

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not doing design systems like this, you‚Äôre doing it wrong‚Äù. Sound familiar?

Establishing and running design systems has never felt more like a strict set of criteria to meet. But what are we missing out as we become more rigid about how we define and practice design systems? And what value might lie in loosening our grip?

In this talk, Amy explores the impact of dogmatism in the field of design systems, and the opportunities a more flexible approach might bring.

Presented by Amy Hupe at Clarity 2022, on November 10th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Sam Kapila.

## [Ben Callahan: ‚ÄúDesign Systems Culture‚Äù ‚Äî Clarity 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TunUx0a363o)

The culture around your design system is greatly impacted by the culture of your organization. In this presentation, Ben will share how this understanding will impact the way you approach creating a sustainable systematic design practice. We'll examine the various types of organizational cultures and consider how they work together (and how they don't). The hardest work we have to do is the cultural work. This presentation will help you face that challenge head-on and shape your approach, making things more likely to succeed.

Presented by Ben Callahan at Clarity 2022, on November 11th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Jeremy Keith.

## [Ashleigh Axios: ‚ÄúConfronting Stigma Traps in Healthcare‚Äù ‚Äî Clarity 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ1tkV5fbdY)

Healthcare in the U.S. promises to maintain or improve quality of life by enhancing care while doing ‚Äúno harm.‚Äù And yet, it regularly enforces stigmas. Today, both promise and reality collide in healthcare systems as they grapple with old ways of working, pressures for greater inclusion and equity, and the need to fundamentally reframe core issues. How can we help?

ÔªøIn this insightful and impassioned talk, Ashleigh will identify ways stigmas persist in popular yet problematic healthcare frames, highlight the too-often neglected issues the existing frames obscure, and suggest things we can do as designers and system shapers to help healthcare systems course correct.

You‚Äôll gain a new perspective, learn when not to make it about people, and may even become inspired to help transform healthcare.

A discussion of the way the capitalist context prevents designers from doing their best work. Capitalism demands the extraction of ever-growing profits from the user, which inevitably leads to their exploitation. As designers, we strive to give users agency, but our jobs can demand that we strip it away. How can we advocate for our users' needs when the forces of capital have stacked the deck against them?

Many inaccessible products still get shipped to users today. Often, devs get told they can "fix it later". Why fix it later, when you could build it right to start with? Great design documentation helps teams implement accessibility requirements. Let's talk about how designers can use this, to bake accessibility into the whole project, from the start!

One constant of design systems is that they‚Äôre always changing. As they morph and grow, our understanding of them evolves. In this talk, I‚Äôd like to share examples of how apparently small shifts in design systems can make a big difference in how we think about them, and how we continue to recast their role. I‚Äôd also like to celebrate the diversity of systems, and highlight the variety of ways they‚Äôre fit for purpose.

## [Kathryn Gonzalez: ‚ÄúDesign Systems from Startup to IPO and Beyond‚Äù ‚Äî Clarity 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpcyo9mtwWE)

Design Systems as a practice is a relatively young and growing part of the design and engineering community. For many design systems, they are built at different stages of a company‚Äôs life‚Äîfor older companies, to manage the chaos and debt of existing design and product decisions, for younger companies to wrangle a growing organization and team to help them scale for the future.

As DoorDash‚Äôs first product designer and frontend engineer, Kathryn has seen the impact of building a design system from the very earliest days as a small, scrappy team of 8 engineers and 1 designer, all the way to IPO in 2020, to a company now with thousands of engineers and a design team of a 100+. She‚Äôll talk through the lessons she‚Äôs learned, the ways she and her team have adapted to the different needs of a company at different stages, how no matter what stage you‚Äôre at as a company, you can find value in a design systems practice.

Native HTML Form Controls can be some of the most painful elements to style and customize. 25 years after the first HTML Standard introduced them and developers have resorted to building custom controls from scratch to achieve what they need to. 

I‚Äôll discuss the history behind native form controls, where we‚Äôre at presently with styling them and take a look at the proposed solutions by standards groups and browser vendors to standardize controls and solve the pain points developers have been complaining about for years.

## [Donna Vitan: ‚ÄúResilient Design Systems for Resilient People‚Äù ‚Äî Clarity 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWTeS4cuMfc)

Design systems help scale the brand's visual language, design and technology decisions, and accessibility across the organization's digital experiences. Our delivery teams depend on the design system to help provide what good looks like, and often rely on the design systems team to maintain it, add features, and help throughout the contribution process. But what happens when your design systems team disbands?

Let‚Äùs talk about the highs and lows of working on a design system, becoming a user of a minimally supported design system, and returning to the design systems' team a little wiser and hopeful. I'll share a bit about our biggest challenge yet, rebuilding trust with the community while ambitiously rebranding on a new technology.

Takeaways:
- Relate to the personal, emotional rollercoaster, of being on a design systems team
- Learn about features and practices to make your design system more robust and self-sufficient
- Learn what to prioritize to continue creating a design system people want to use

## [Helen Hou-Sandi: ‚ÄúWhere Design Systems meet Editorial Experiences‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_wJWTqpVWU)

Design systems aren't just for software and product teams‚Äîthey're for content websites, too. But it's one thing to come up with a design system for a website, and another to translate it for the people who manage the content that goes into your carefully crafted design system. They say software is eating the world, but I would venture to say that even more people are involved in the care and maintenance of websites, and it's important that they're remembered as the standards rise ever higher.

Let's explore some strategies for translating parts of a design system for editorial needs - the functional spec, if you will - and take a look at some real-world examples of how powerful that can be in a visual editing experience in a popular CMS.

Jen Cotton Head of Design & Research Modern Health

People are using more devices than ever. The median US household contains at least 5 devices, with similar trends across comparable markets. For a large part this is due to innovation in the devices space over the past 5 years. New hardware categories like smart speakers have been created, while other categories have gained broader adoption due to category leaders, such as AirPods driving wearables growth.

At the same time the capabilities of our devices are more inclusive, opening up new ways for people to interact using voice and gesture for the first time. Better still, the more ambient nature of devices like speakers or displays create the possibility for better digital wellbeing and point towards what a post-mobile future might look like.

Yet most of our design systems only focus on phones and computers.

Let‚Äôs explore how cross-device hardware trends and use cases can help drive our design systems towards a truly responsive and inclusive future.

Modern challenges are complex, requiring a systemic approach to problem solving. Solutions that improve lives can only be achieved through a deep understanding of the ecosystems at play, the people affected, the processes involved, and the pain points experienced. The result of this approach is service design that is both nuanced and wide-ranging.

John Voss Senior Design Manager, UI Design & Design Systems Stitch Fix

Digital product teams have a problem with addiction: we see it as a product strategy. We talk about getting users hooked. About driving engagement through addictive experiences. About binging content for a dopamine hit.

By adopting the language of addiction in our process, we embed harmful patterns of thought in the patterns we design. These become harmful patterns of behavior in the people who use our products. It‚Äôs time to break the cycle.

Some brands have very loyal customers due to their product‚Äôs being reliable and having a high quality level. This is the same when constructing design system components that designers and engineers use everyday when building features. You not only need to make sure they‚Äôre functional and align to the product's aesthetics, but they also have to be performant, accessible and scalable. Having buggy components will decrease confidence for the design system.

One way to minimize bugs in components is to use a BDD approach. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a programming style where tests are created from the user‚Äôs perspective before code is written. But what are the most effective ways to implement BDD when building components? How can BDD be beneficial to developers and also designers, researchers and QA?

The audience will learn:
- The benefits of BDD and TDD
- Techniques on how to implement BDD into a design system process
- How to leverage automating testing while building components

At the close of 2020, our team shipped dark mode for GitHub. It was an immensely popular feature with our customers, but also turned out to be a great tool for design systems adoption internally. We didn‚Äôt just build dark mode though, we built a color system that enabled us to ship other popular and necessary themes too. In this talk I‚Äôd like to shine a light on the infrastructure behind dark mode, show how themeability is not just for color, and share why I think a themeable design system will help you scale into the future.

At this point, we‚Äôve probably all frequently heard the phrase ‚Äúdesign and engineering gap‚Äù, especially in the world of design systems. There are tools, books, blog posts, and talks all built around trying to bridge this gap, but what if the key to creating more cohesive and inclusive teams is really the people within those teams? Instead of bridging a gap, what if we eliminate it altogether with a group of people called Design Technologists. They‚Äôre typically familiar with design and research best practices, yet also talented at creating accessible, scalable components with APIs that engineering teams can easily understand and utilize. They understand the language of both worlds already, so why not lean into this role and mindset when creating design systems with a shared language. 

Let‚Äôs discuss what exactly Design Technology entails, how this role creates stronger teams and tighter connections across an organization, and how everyone can think like a Design Technologist, regardless of their title.

In 2005, I was asked by the AIGA what advice I had for someone beginning a career in design. I responded with a 541-word essay that became one of the most popular things I‚Äôve ever written. It was widely quoted. A few people even told me it has changed their lives. But here‚Äôs the catch: fifteen years later, I‚Äôve begun to realize I was wrong.

How wrong? Well, that‚Äôs for you to decide. Now that I‚Äôm at the far end of a 40-year career, I hope this will be a chance for you (and me) to learn from my mistakes.

## [Lauren LoPrete: ‚ÄúDesign Systems Burnout‚Äù ‚Äî Clarity 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d22qO_RvaQc)

Building design systems is a thankless job. It feels like some days the quality of the product's UI is weighing on your shoulders and others like you're being critiqued for stifling the design team's creativity. When you build an internal product for your peers, critical feedback becomes personal and can demotivate or derail your team. It can feel like sprints and quarters are spent reacting to the needs of others, and your roadmap is commanded by the teams you support. Acting in a support role means you're responsible for defining your team's motivation, milestones, success... and how your work impacts the business overall. 

Writing this talk began as a way to cope with burnout after 4 years of working on design systems. Intended as a cathartic moment of self-reflection, this talk will pull from personal experiences [in hope of] providing practical strategies that break the cycles of fatigue, stress, and overwhelm; empowering design systems leaders to define their focus and what really matters.

The language we use to describe effective design systems seems so similar to the language we use to describe how effective teams work.

‚ÄúAuthentic and genuine principles‚Äù, ‚Äúa shared language‚Äù, ‚Äúclear channels of communication‚Äù, ‚Äúclear governance structures‚Äù, ‚Äúfrequent checkups‚Äù.

See what I mean? Read any decent article or book on effective design systems or effective teams and these üëÜüèæ concepts are gonna come up. Why? Because a team is also a system. It‚Äôs just that we don‚Äôt think of it that way, because its ‚Äúpeople stuff‚Äù. So we avoid it. Because ‚Äúpeople stuff‚Äù is ‚Äúhard‚Äù.

I‚Äôd like to convince you otherwise. In this talk I‚Äôll share practical tips on how any team can become more effective when it thinks of itself as a system. Not only that, I‚Äôll show how to do this using some of the core principles and techniques we already know, love, and use to build effective design systems.

You don‚Äôt have to be a lead or a manager to make your team more inclusive and effective. You just need to care about design, systems, and people. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre here right?

## [Asia Hoe: ‚ÄúThe Systems of Design‚Äù ‚Äî Clarity 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPhzFp8AAT0)

Design, and in turn, Design Systems, are innately political. When done well, design makes products and services more accessible, inclusive, and equitable. But what about the systems that enable and teach us the expression of design? Looking at everything from the software and hardware we use, to the internet service providers that enable us to enjoy cloud based software, this talk reveals the inequity in the systems that power design, and what we can do about it to enable a brighter, more diverse, and more inclusive future.

You‚Äôve got a design system, now what? At Atlassian we‚Äôve evolved what it means to create, adopt, and maintain a design system over the past 5 years, from a product for products, to a service for people. In this talk, I'll dig deep into who the consumers of our systems are, and some of the things we've done (some that worked, others that didn't) to meet their needs.

You've heard about accessibility, and people keep talking about making products more inclusive. But what does that mean? Why does it matter? And how do you do it? Can design systems help? In this talk, we‚Äôll go beyond simple color contrast to understand foundational accessibility and inclusion principles. You‚Äôll leave with concrete steps you can take to make your products more accessible and inclusive without dedicated resources.

While in the weeds of a design project, it‚Äôs easy to lose track of an overall objective. Especially if you‚Äôre only responsible for a small piece of that objective. But design should always come from a perspective. Usually that perspective is developed at the origin of the brand. In this session, Ben will go through the process of developing a brand perspective, and how that can affect design decisions down the road.

## [Tatiana Mac: ‚ÄúSystem of Systems‚Äù ‚Äî Clarity 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzGfBV67Tac)

Design systems create an umbrella to to define the future of our design work. But design systems are not the biggest umbrella, so to speak‚Äîthey exist under broader social, political, and infrastructural systems that affect the parameters, limitations, and variables of our system.

Investigating design systems across many verticals, we'll look to see how design systems are impacted by the systems they live within. And beyond the verticals, we'll look to see how broader systems of power and oppression influence the design systems, and ultimately, the users who use the products defined by them.

We'll look to see how to assess where our design systems live in broader ecosystems, the challenges inherent, and how to lean into the good, and resist the bad, to ensure we're serving all humans in an equitable and ethical way, maintaining safety and trust.

Resource Hints are a great way for developers to make their web pages faster by allowing us to be a little bit smarter than the browser. Although not a new specification‚Äîthey‚Äôve been around in some form or another for years!‚Äîare we truly getting the most out of them? And do we understand them thoroughly enough to use them most effectively? Heck, do we even know what a ‚ÄòResource Hint‚Äô is?! Well, by the end of this talk, we‚Äôll all be experts.

Let‚Äôs take a look at all of the different Resource Hints we have available to us, real-world examples of how best to use them, and learn about some of the more obscure intricacies and gotchas that we need to be aware of if we want to really get the best out of them (and to make sure that we really are being smarter than the browser).

By taking advantage of technologies, some new and some overlooked, we can create a progressively-enhanced design that‚Äôs powered by feature queries; one that‚Äôs localized for an increasingly global audience. In this talk drawn from her work for Slack and other properties, Mina walks through her process for enhancing design and shows how little changes lead to big design payoffs.

When your type and color say one thing, but your use of animation says another, things can get confusing. Defining how your brand should express itself in motion gives you the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of your UI animation efforts, and establishes a concrete way to ensure your UI animations share a common thread both with each other, and with the rest of your design efforts.

In this session, Val will show you how to harness the design details of UI animation to reinforce your intended design messaging. By using every tool at our disposal, we can create more expressive products that feel cohesive across all of today's diverse contexts.

Despite the prevalent mythology of the lone creative genius, many of the most innovative contributions spring from the creative chemistry of a group and the blending of everyone‚Äôs ideas and concepts. How can we best leverage this collective wisdom to generate creative synergy and co-create? Let‚Äôs look at the process of recognizing and removing our personal creative blocks, connecting and communicating with others, combining ideas using play, and constructing a collaborative environment to discover effective methods for tapping into a group‚Äôs creative brilliance. Through these steps, you‚Äôll learn to capitalize on the super-linearity of creativity to embrace and leverage diversity to create better together.

Let‚Äôs face it: design systems are tools to largely help developers to create well-designed products. And that‚Äôs great! Consistency, headstarts, and shared standards are good for everyone. But where does that leave designers? How do we exercise the advantages of gorgeous art direction and intuitive interaction design? Why does it feel like the job we‚Äôve been successfully doing for years is quickly fading away? Dan Mall has been coaching and working with in-house teams on their design systems for a few years. In this talk, he‚Äôll share what he‚Äôs learned about each team member‚Äôs role, where to be efficient vs. where to be experimental, and how we can all better collaborate to benefit from everyone‚Äôs knowledge and skills.

Design Systems have changed the way that developers and designers collaborate on fonts, colors, UI structure, forms and the like. So why does it feel like animation in a design system always falls short? The animation section usually lays dormant aside from a "fade", or we craft one-offs for a perfect experience, but each perfect experience becomes less perfect because they don't share the same language. In this talk, we'll break down exactly how to build animations so that they're composable, extendable, and can be used for a multitude of purchases, and still maintain cohesion. We'll talk about how animation in specific requires teams to work together because it's an intersection of design and development: it's harder to throw over a wall. We'll break down exactly how to make it all fit together, for the most seamless collaboration between you and your team.

The same general trajectory: a decent idea executed flawlessly by a cohesive team of hard workers. No matter the project, everything can be achieved following this general guideline. But the exact thing that can create global companies, solve impossible problems and bring ideas to life is also the same reason why so many companies fail. That *thing* is us. People. And when we‚Äôre at our best, there isn‚Äôt anything we can't do. So how do we optimize collaboration? How do we work better together even if we don‚Äôt see eye-to-eye with everyone on our teams? And how do we create a culture of empathy when all we can see about everyone around us is our differences?

This talk will explore empathy in an unusual way: from the perspective of a stutterer. We‚Äôll examine what empathy truly is (and is not) and reveal the specific actions individuals must engage in daily to create a culture of empathy on their team.

The People Layer is the deepest, most complex layer of any organization. It‚Äôs a layer of interaction that persists beyond changes in aesthetics, technologies, devices, systems, tools, and trends. Everyone is involved, and everyone can solve for it.

## [Diana Mounter: ‚ÄúThe Interaction of Color Systems‚Äù ‚Äî Clarity 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3ydDa9QLIY)

Color is the most relative medium in art. This fact makes working with color in design systems particularly challenging. Few people seem to want to claim to be an expert in color‚Äîperhaps because there‚Äôs an immensely deep amount to learn, or perhaps it‚Äôs because color is one of those things we hate to get wrong. Whatever the reason, color remains a contentious but often critical part of design.

I‚Äôll be sharing my journey into color, from the technical challenges to how people respond to it. We‚Äôll take a look at the efforts required in updating large scale web applications like GitHub, testing the interaction of color with other parts of a design system, creating color naming conventions, color contrast, and color system use outside of the product UI.

A very common question I get, whether at a conference, on a panel or even from people I work with at BuzzFeed, is what my day-to-day work is like as a VP of Design. Since no one week or day is exactly the same, I've historically had trouble answering this question. No more!

In this talk, I‚Äôll detail a full, actual week of being a VP of Design at BuzzFeed, along with some lessons I‚Äôve learned in my role that I have found to apply broadly to leaders across all levels of an organization.

Just as there‚Äôs no one way to make a website, there is no one way to make a design system. While there are several ‚Äúbest practices‚Äù that have emerged, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for creating a design system. And sometimes, the best solution means going against industry standards.

In this talk, Mina will discuss her experiences building systems at two highly visible, and vastly different, organizations: Hillary for America and Slack. She‚Äôll tell you all the things and all the ways she got it wrong, while somehow making it work.

Throughout history, our tools have affected how we understand the world. In our young industry, our tools, needs, and processes are constantly changing. We build sites and frameworks and components with the tools we have at hand. As we do, we discover problems, invent solutions, and then invent new tools.

Design Systems are our current model of making sense of the intersection of front-end code and design. With the tools we have today, what is our working model of a component? How do we define them, create them, and ensure they work at scale? In this talk we‚Äôll discuss how our tools affect our understanding, create a checklist of factors that make a component a component, and how to implement the theory of components with the tools you have at hand.

‚Äî

One benefit of design systems is that they help ensure consistency across surfaces, platforms, and projects. The BBC claims that their design system, GEL enables them to ‚Äúcreate consistent and delightful user experiences‚Äù while Salesforce highlights consistency as one of their four design principles. But what does consistency mean in practice and when can it create conflict in a design system?

In this talk, we‚Äôll take a look at the differing types of consistency (internal, external, and real-world) and how they work in digital and physical interfaces, and we‚Äôll go a step further and dive into the myriad reasons that inconsistency can make sense, too. You‚Äôll walk away with a framework for making better trade-offs when deciding for or against consistency.

I built Susy, a Sass grid system that can generate any grid technique you like ‚Äî but I haven't used it in years. I'll show you how various grid systems work, and how to avoid using them. For those few cases where a grid really is required, we'll talk about the best ways to roll your own, so you're not relying on a bloated library to make decisions for you. We'll also look at the new layout toys ‚Äî from flexbox to CSS Grid ‚Äî and how to get started with only a few lines of code.

- When to use floats, CSS Grid, flexbox, custom properties, and other techniques.
- How to make grid-math simple, and lose the grid-system.
- How to make grid-systems work for you when you need them.

When we align, we seek positive outcomes for a system whose components may range from people to patterns, beliefs to behaviors, and much more. When we align, we arrive at a shared understanding of priorities, efficiencies, and tradeoffs. When we align, the result is purposeful and even beautiful.

In this keynote, Cameron will discuss three aspects of alignment within systems, not the least of which are design systems, and the remarkable outcomes that are made possible when we align.

The federal government, bound by centuries of history and numerous regulations, has historically built online experiences that reflect bureaucracy rather than human needs. Government websites that don't meet user needs produce poor outcomes and worse opinions about the government. We‚Äôre doing something about this. During the summer of 2015, a team came together to create the Draft US Web Design Standards: open source UI components and a visual style guide to create consistent, cohesive, and easy-to-use user experiences across federal government websites.

We‚Äôll explore:

- How to create a style guide in a highly complex, old system with multiple stakeholders and different end users
- How to make easy-to-use tools that solve real user needs
- How we're creating a nexus for industry best practices and collaboration across government agencies and with the public

A pattern language is a method of describing good design practices within a field of expertise. This talk is an exercise to coalesce a pattern language for web development, in particular the discipline of front-end web design and development. It goes beyond the elements that comprise a design system or style guide focusing on the larger system of practices that contribute to delightful experiences for those that craft and code the experiences and interact with our web applications.

This talk is meant to spark a conversation. It is by no means a definite list of all the patterns, that can only be accomplished collectively.

A quick web search can bring up thousands of code samples for any type of component one could imagine building, but 90% of that code isn‚Äôt accessible, unintentionally leaving huge audiences of users behind. You have the power to change this! As the people creating style guides and component systems, you‚Äôre uniquely positioned to get accessibility right the first time and spread best practices to everyone who uses your code. In this talk, you‚Äôll learn the key ingredients for baking accessibility into your design system, including mindful color palettes, semantic HTML, and a dash of ARIA.

Animation is key component of beautiful and useful product design. Salesforce, Google, and IBM all feature motion design in their design systems, and there‚Äôs every reason you should, too. When designers and developers agree upon constraints, they can create UI components faster and present a unified, polished look and feel users appreciate.

Communicating animation is all about identifying patterns and setting boundaries and behavior expectations. This means:

- creating custom easings that reinforce branding and physics
- choreographing scalable timing values
- creating a vocabulary of reusable components
- combining those components into unique yet universal animation patterns.

Whether your project is big or small, if it has a style guide, you will want to include motion design. In this talk, you will learn how to bring animation to heel.

Style Guides and Pattern Libraries are great tools for documenting the relationships between code and design, but beautiful docs and consistent UI are only half the battle. Somewhere, behind the scenes, those patterns have to live in our code, and hopefully make life easier for developers. We can go beyond ‚Äúliving‚Äù style guides to find tools that encourage and document pattern-making from the ground up, across projects, without adding developer overhead. From Sass maps and Jinja macros, to front-end architecture and style-guide generators ‚Äî let‚Äôs talk about the code patterns that make our UI patterns possible.

A design system is made up of parts: visual style, UI components, code, editorial, and often more. We know how to design, build, deliver them is like any other digital product development process. And there‚Äôs the rub: your system is a product in and of itself, applied to an enterprise's ecosystem of other products built by autonomous teams of designers and developers.

Your strategy needs answers to ‚ÄúWhat products will use it, when and to what
extent?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs our audience?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho participates and contributes?‚Äù 
‚ÄúWhat groups must we align with?‚Äù ‚ÄúWho wants it, and ‚Äî really ‚Äî who doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù

Modularity has been around for a long time now; concepts like object-oriented programming predate the Web by a long shot. So why the sudden interest in pattern libraries and design systems on the Web? We‚Äôre tasked with creating experiences that look and function beautifully across a dizzying array of devices, browsers, screen sizes, network connections, locales, and environments. That‚Äôs a tall order in and of itself, but once you factor in team members, clients, stakeholders, and organizational quirks, things start looking downright intimidating. Style guides and design systems provide solid ground for us to stand on as we tackle this increasingly-diverse Web landscape.

Design systems support consistency but also vehicles for communication and change. Here we look at how you can introduce design tokens considering theming and really bring out the power of what your system can be.

Here is Amy Hupe, discussing design system contribution. 

Contribution is considered an essential part of most design systems. Inviting insights and improvements from a design system's community of users is what makes it reliable and representative. So why do so many of us find it so hard to achieve and sustain? Are we going about it all wrong, or is there something more insidious at play here? Amy explains why she thinks design systems contribution is ultimately destined to fail and why - against the odds - we should keep going anyway.

The first ever ConvergeLDN took place on 21st September as part of World Design Systems Week. Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! 

Watch Lily Dart discuss the culture and good and bad aspects of design systems. 

If you‚Äôre interested in design systems, you‚Äôve no doubt dreamt of the kind of design system you‚Äôd like to build. Perhaps you know precisely what tooling you‚Äôd use or how you‚Äôd structure the components. A design system that is elegant, easy to use, and produces beautiful results. But if you‚Äôve tried creating a design system, you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll achieve your original aspirations. Arguments over standards, complexity in tooling and abuses, and mis-uses of the libraries are all common pitfalls for new systems. 

So why is it so hard to build a great design system? A successful system is more than UI and code. What underpins every system - good or bad -  is culture. And without the right culture, your beautiful design system will fail. Based on her experience running the first-ever design systems team at Lloyds Banking Group, Lily will be talking about the relationship between design systems and organizational culture. How to identify yours, when to design for it, and when to fight against it.

In fact, you should tackle the most challenging complex work first to make the future easier.

## [Converge London 2022 - Imran Azfal - Reflective Practice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blt-dKZAR7k)

The first ever ConvergeLDN took place on 21st September as part of World Design Systems Week. Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! 

In this talk, Imran Afzal talks about reflective practice. 

Whatever role we play, it‚Äôs critical that we stay relevant. Continuous learning is a must. There‚Äôs very little allowance for our approach or knowledge to stagnate in UX. However, we all lead busy lives in a fast-paced society. Rarely is there a moment to stop and think. If we‚Äôre not jumping from one product release to another, we‚Äôre feeling the pressure of delivering high-quality work, quickly. This can harm our long-term success and impact.

However, reflective practice can help. By taking time out to think about our actions, we can learn from our experiences and use that knowledge to evolve our mindset. Imran discusses what it means to reflect on our experiences and the impact of that process on our future. The talk explores the benefits of taking time to reflect, while also providing guidance on introducing reflective practice into your work.

## [Converge London 2022 - Inayaili Le√≥n: DesignOps - The API of Design Teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkVqvz2DtMs)

The first ever ConvergeLDN took place on 21st September as part of World Design Systems Week. Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems! 

Here is Inayaili Le√≥n from GitHub, discussing the API of design teams. 

DesignOps is the glue that keeps a design org together, and the connective tissue that links design to other disciplines across the company, and beyond. Even if your company doesn‚Äôt have a formal DesignOps team, this work is likely being done by someone.

## [Automatically create a changelog for your design system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjvcRCuv6FQ)

We've added a "What's new" block that automatically generates a list of pages that have been added, changed, or deleted. You can show any changes from the last 30 days or since your last release. 

This should make it a lot easier to maintain a changelog, create release notes, or keep styleguide viewers up to date on how your documentation is evolving.

## [Amplify Webinar: Women in Tech Wikipedia Edit-a-thon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYhZ4exUyiQ)

For¬†International Women‚Äôs Day, the theme is¬†#EmbraceEquity, which inspired us to host an edit-a-thon this month. In this recording, our Design Advocate Michelle walks you through the basics of editing Wikipedia, identifies great places for beginners to edit, and provides a list of pages that could be improved or created. 

We decided to host this because there‚Äôs a huge gender gap on Wikipedia. In less than 19% of biographies on Wikipedia are about women. Wikipedia is a data source on many things we rely on - from Google‚Äôs knowledge panels to what teaches AI systems. When women aren‚Äôt represented in Wikipedia, we‚Äôre omitted from people‚Äôs knowledge and discussion, and our accomplishments go unknown.

This will be an ongoing project for her and some friends. So if you missed the webinar, you can catch up on this recording and join in a future edit-a-thon session. 

Editing Wikipedia is more user-friendly now, making creating and editing pages even easier. By embracing this learning curve, we can work toward better equity and representation of women in Wikipedia and beyond.

## [How We Document Webinar 1: Starting Design Systems - Navigating the beginning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvwscunUtu4)

From our How We Document 2023 report, most respondents are in the early stages of design system creation. Starting design systems isn‚Äôt just a matter of designing a few components. These days it‚Äôs much more than that. Teams are documenting sooner and including tokens earlier. 

Learn from our amazing panelists, Lily Dart and Julien Vani√®re about how they‚Äôve approached starting a design system. When should you start documenting? How soon should you include tokens? What are common mistakes and how can we avoid them?

## [Elevate your DesignOps ‚Äî Streamline your design processes, with Supernova](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oL5pv1LDLwk)

Design operations and design systems go hand-in-hand when it comes to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of your design process.  A well-designed design system can be vital to a successful DesignOps strategy because it provides a framework for designers to work within and reduces the time they need to spend on repetitive tasks like creating new UI components.  Once it is well-implemented, a design system continues to help DesignOps ensure the needs of the design team and organization as a whole.

## [&quot;Killing the spreadsheet behind every design system&quot; by Jiri Trecak @ Into Design Systems Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8RWBd5_9Y8)

Each design system consists of many moving parts - some live in Figma, some live in our codebases, and some.. in Spreadsheets, that are used to track everything from links to health statuses to information about changes to specific elements. It is time we remove this last broken part completely.

In this lesson, we‚Äôll:

- Learn what a design system is and what‚Äôs included in one;
- Explore the problems a design system can help solve;
- Help you identify when you need one;
- And highlight a few things to consider as you start your design systems journey.

Documentation is the how. It communicates the purpose of all these aspects of your design system and how best to apply them.

Documentation can look like:

- On-canvas annotations for components in design files
- Style and component descriptions in Figma
- Naming-structures in a library or codebase
- Written articles and guides
- or dedicated websites and tools

Processes are just as important as the tools and assets within the system. It‚Äôs important to establish these with your contributors before a design system goes live.

They capture the mechanics and governance for managing a design system:

- How to make updates to a system and share them with others
- Who to give feedback to and how
- How to get changes to the system approved
- How to collaborate with cross-functional teams
- How to provide training to new members of the team
- and more

## [Figma tutorial: Intro to variables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ONxxlJnvdM)

Figma is free to use. Sign up here: https://bit.ly/3msp0OV

By definition, a variable is something that can vary in value or take on multiple values. Variables in Figma store reusable values, like color values and numbers, that can be applied to all kinds of design properties and even prototypes! A variable‚Äôs values can also reference other variables, making updating design systems a breeze. In this video, we‚Äôll cover how variables work, and how to use them to represent design tokens and account for different modes and themes.

* Update: When following along with the tutorial at 10:30,  the variable called ".5" will no longer work.  This is due to our alignment with the W3C spec which doesn't allow periods in names.  Calling the variable "spacing/half" will work, instead.
We are doing a follow-up in the next coming months where we‚Äôll be separating out the ‚Äúfigma name‚Äù from the code syntax, which may let us loosen these restrictions.  Keep an eye out for additional syntax support in the future.

## [UnConference: Design Systems Culture with Ben Callahan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV-qvJ-F48Q)

A design system is often an expression (for better or worse) of the values of the people that build it. This is why design systems flounder‚Äîthey are often launched as a bridge between teams without an understanding of the various subcultures of those teams. When companies align their design system with and make them work for their existing company culture, the goals for that system are more easily realized.

If you feel like you‚Äôre swimming upstream with your design system, it could be the result of a cultural problem‚Äînot a technical one. It‚Äôs time for you to look at your design system from a different angle.

In this virtual learning event, Ben Callahan will show you how design systems and company culture are inextricably linked and how a deeper understanding of each is necessary to get you where you want to go.

## [Getting Started with Design Systems | Create a Design System in Sketch, Ep1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3eVHGTIzTI)

Episode 1: Getting Started with Design Systems

Note: apologies for potato sound quality... microphones are still tricky to get right.

This video will kickstart the new mini-tutorial series on creating your own design system using Sketch app. I‚Äôll walk you through key steps, caveats, pros and cons to making a design system and more. 

A design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer‚Äôs friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organizations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles.

Episode 2: Set up an Atomic Design Structure

In this episode, I'll show you how to quickly set up your Sketch file to better accommodate the Atomic Design steps (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and pages). This is one of the most important steps while creating an easy to maintain and experiment with design pattern library.

## [Atoms - Create a Design System in Sketch, Ep3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDpUOcfxXDI)

Episode 3: Atoms

In this session, we will start deconstructing a proven UI mockup into the smallest UI particles - atoms. This is a first step at defining a new Atomic Design system in Sketch. We'll use existing Sketch symbol features as well as previously (ep2) defined system structure.

Episode 14: Ultimate UI Wireframe Kit?

This week‚Äôs pick: 
UI Wireframe Kit from Semplice Supply. After using this clean and beautiful kit in a few projects to date I was surprised how flexible, quick to modify it is. Having a kit like that in your product design (UX/UI) toolkit can help you mockup and validate ideas instantly and produce wireframes that look stunning. 

Take a look and give it a go here: https://www.semplice.com/semplice-supply-ui-kit

## [Data Visualisation and Chart Design System for Sketch - Design Tool Tuesday, Ep17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oH5kaioX7A)

Episode 17: Data Visualisation and Chart Design System for Sketch

This week‚Äôs pick: Charts for Sketch. A design system made to cover any and all diagram, chart and data visualisation UI patterns. This design system is extremely easy to use and is built with the Atomic design framework in mind. Meaning, you'll have an option to easily maintain this living UX design system document or simply copy-paste the elements you need in your work. This sketch library comes with a lot of cases covered, I couldn't think of anything lacking. Best part? it's free.

Note: we're not affiliated with the tool makers. It's just a great UX tool you should know about.

## [Mix'n'match UI Patterns Into Organisms - Create a Design System in Sketch, Ep5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0roPkORwmk)

Episode 5: Mix'n'match UI Patterns Into Organisms

In this video, we will continue crafting atoms, molecules and the new construct in the Atomic Design system hierarchy - Organisms. We will combine previously covered atom and molecule patterns into intuitive and easy to maintain  a set of patterns.

A design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer‚Äôs friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organisations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles.

## [Templates and Pages in Design Systems - Create a Design System in Sketch, Ep6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E940UPw57U)

Episode 6: Templates and Pages in Design Systems

In this video, we'll continue where we left off by setting up the initial atomic design system template. We already covered atoms, molecules and organisms in the previous videos. Now's the time to finalise the technical aspects of maintaining the design system and introducing flexible UX templates and pages structure. I'll show you not only how to port existing components, but also what you should do if you plan to introduce new UI patterns: update, maintain and roll out your design system in Sketch app.

Episode 7: Developer Handovers with Zeplin

If you're a Sketch user and have been following along this design system tutorial series you probably have already noticed the gradual transition from the smallest atoms to pages that need to be somehow implemented. Too often expectations and design details get lost in the weeds because of the lack of a common environment to retain all the UI patterns. In this video on design systems, I'll share some of the easiest ways to perform design asset handovers to your front-end developers - Zeplin.

## [Design Systems: Getting Business Buy-in - Create a Design System in Sketch, Ep8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlBziCCzHuk)

Episode 8: Design Systems: Getting Business Buy-in 

In this video, I'll discuss the biggest issue that designers and engineers alike face when trying to introduce the very first atomic design system -- getting the buy-in from the business. Some designers don't even know where to start, others continuously struggle to convey design system value. There is one simple (not easy) workaround to conveying the value the businesses seek immediately. And it doesn't matter if you are using Sketch or Figma or what sort of organisation you're part of. If this is your first initiative with design systems - check the video. These principles will work for almost any design based initiative.

Episode 9: Making Design System a Success

In this episode for creating fully functional atomic design systems from scratch, I'll talk about 2 vital parts making this effort a success. Too often efforts that are done in isolation and that lack necessary buy-ins tend to end up collecting dust. What was meant to be transformative new living product design system becomes a crutch? This video will help you understand how to set up the right structures for people and underlying process so that you can start a system, but also ensure it will become an integral part of new feature design and development.

## [Best Starter Kit for a New Design System? - Design Tool Tuesday, Ep37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnB_3pVLsCI)

Episode 37: Best Starter Kit for a New Design System?

This week‚Äôs pick: Details design system. A kit that I've used to start scalable and powerful UI and product design systems in an Atomic Design framework for quite some time. Details kit provides a simple yet structured starter for any designer to customise. Better yet, you can download Sketch and/or Figma version of their Atoms (and some of the molecules) for free. It doesn't get better than this, especially if you've been planning to create a decent system for one of your products or services.

Note: we're not affiliated with the tool makers. It's just a great UX tool you should know about.

In this new weekly UX design, user research and product design tools series I'll share some of the best picks I've encountered to date. You'll find out about the best apps, extensions, websites and other helpful tools.
