I’ve been quietly working on a monster of a new #designsystems course, and it’s almost done. I’m aiming to launch it at the beginning of the new year. 

It’s 80 separate modules, and over 10 hours of videos to watch. 

Don’t know how to make a #designsystem in Figma? This course will teach you how from scratch… no prior Figma experience needed.

Don’t know how to make a #designsystem in code? This course will teach you how from scratch… no prior coding experience needed.

I want everyone who wants to learn more about design systems to be able to do so, no matter how much you know or don’t know already or where in the world you come from. 

What’s a price that would be a no-brainer for you to pay for this kind of training?
