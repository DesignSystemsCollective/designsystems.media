John Voss Senior Design Manager, UI Design & Design Systems Stitch Fix

Digital product teams have a problem with addiction: we see it as a product strategy. We talk about getting users hooked. About driving engagement through addictive experiences. About binging content for a dopamine hit.

By adopting the language of addiction in our process, we embed harmful patterns of thought in the patterns we design. These become harmful patterns of behavior in the people who use our products. It’s time to break the cycle.

Presented by John Voss at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021. Ends with an interview with Mina Markham.
