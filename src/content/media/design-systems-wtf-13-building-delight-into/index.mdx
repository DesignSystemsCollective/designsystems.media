Is there space for fun and delight in your design system?

We tackle a question that often gets overlooked in the world of design systems: Is there room for fun and delight? Sure, components are the workhorses of design systems, known for their functionality and consistency, but does that mean they have to be dull? We’ll explore the possibilities of infusing a bit of charm and personality into your design system. 

Listen in as we discuss examples of some of the more fun design systems in action, the challenges of maintaining usability while injecting creativity, and how to strike the right balance.

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
