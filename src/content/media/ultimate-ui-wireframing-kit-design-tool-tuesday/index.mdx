Episode 14: Ultimate UI Wireframe Kit?

This week’s pick:
UI Wireframe Kit from Semplice Supply. After using this clean and beautiful kit in a few projects to date I was surprised how flexible, quick to modify it is. Having a kit like that in your product design (UX/UI) toolkit can help you mockup and validate ideas instantly and produce wireframes that look stunning.

Take a look and give it a go here: https://www.semplice.com/semplice-supply-ui-kit

In this new weekly UX design, user research and product design tools series I'll share some of the best picks I've encountered to date. You'll find out about the best apps, extensions, websites and other helpful tools.
