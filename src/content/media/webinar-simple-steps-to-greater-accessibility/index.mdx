Join us in celebrating Global Accessibility Awareness Day with an empowering webinar, “Simple steps to greater accessibility.” Discover how small, actionable changes can make a big impact in your workplace.

Whether it’s enhancing document formatting, adopting plain language, or establishing essential standards, we discuss how to make accessibility less daunting and more doable for everyone around you. We’ also explore how to champion these initiatives within your design systems and perhaps even kickstart an accessibility guild.
