Coming off the Dan Mallâ€™s review video of How We Document, we invited Dan for a deeper discussion on some of the How We Document findings. Michelle Chin, our design advocate, and Dan talk about what they found interesting, hot takes based on survey results, and potentially new approaches for documenting, communicating, and positioning design systems.
