Join us for this spontaneous yet deep-dive conversation with typography expert Jason Pamental, recorded live from DÃ¼sseldorf after the Beyond Tellerrand conference. With both guests rocking red beards and decades of experience, we explore responsive web typography, variable fonts, accessibility, performance trade-offs, and why Helvetica might not be your best choice.
