Our Design Systems Journey is a Live Session where a Designer and a Developer meet to talk about their use and understanding of Design Systems. In the end, they'll, fortunately, produce a comprehensive mind map covering the Design Systems to help and guide everyone in this realm.

--- Episode 3: Technologies or Frameworks? 

In this episode, we talk about the development side of Design Systems, trying to figure out what are the differences between Technologies, Frameworks, Librairiesâ€¦ and how we should consider each of them in our Design Systems toolkits.
