Our Design Systems Journey is a Live Session where a Designer and a Developer meet to talk about their use and understanding of Design Systems. In the end, they'll, fortunately, produce a comprehensive mind map covering the Design Systems to help and guide everyone in this realm.

--- Episode 3: Technologies or Frameworks?

In this episode, we talk about the development side of Design Systems, trying to figure out what are the differences between Technologies, Frameworks, Librairies… and how we should consider each of them in our Design Systems toolkits.
