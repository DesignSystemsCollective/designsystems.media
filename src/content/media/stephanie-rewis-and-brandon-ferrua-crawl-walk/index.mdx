If change isn’t built into the process, a “Living Design System” can’t evolve. In this talk we'll discuss the lessons learned, and the challenges faced, as our system went from crawling to running. Refactoring, versioning, and deprecation are but a few of the growing pains we've experienced on our journey to build a stable but incredibly flexible Design System.

Presented by Stephanie Rewis & Brandon Ferrua at Clarity 2016, on March 31st, 2016. Ends with an interview with Chris Coyier
