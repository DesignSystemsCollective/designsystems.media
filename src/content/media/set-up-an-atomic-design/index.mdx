Episode 2: Set up an Atomic Design Structure

In this episode, I'll show you how to quickly set up your Sketch file to better accommodate the Atomic Design steps (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates and pages). This is one of the most important steps while creating an easy to maintain and experiment with design pattern library.

A design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer’s friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organizations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles.
