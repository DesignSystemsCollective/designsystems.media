Creating design education that serves millions of designers and engineers and informs the designs patterns used by billions of people every year is a huge challenge – to say the least. Learn how our small team at Apple works cross-functionally to continually evolve Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines, from its creation in the 1980’s to its latest redesign this year. We’ll share our perspective on how to best design for Apple platforms while retaining your product’s own design system and brand.

Presented by Linda Dong at Clarity 2022, on November 11th, 2022.
