One constant of design systems is that they’re always changing. As they morph and grow, our understanding of them evolves. In this talk, Hayley will share examples of how apparently small shifts in design systems can make a big difference in how we think about them, and how we continue to recast their role. She will also have a good look (& celebrate) the diversity of systems, and highlight the variety of ways they’re fit for purpose.
