Our Design Systems Journey is a Live Session where a Designer (@th4is_ds) and a Developer (@m4d_z) meet to talk about their use and understanding of Design Systems. In the end they'll, fortunately, produce a comprehensive mind map covering the Design Systems to help and guide everyone in this realm.
