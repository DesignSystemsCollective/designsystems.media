At the close of 2020, our team shipped dark mode for GitHub. It was an immensely popular feature with our customers, but also turned out to be a great tool for design systems adoption internally. We didn’t just build dark mode though, we built a color system that enabled us to ship other popular and necessary themes too. In this talk I’d like to shine a light on the infrastructure behind dark mode, show how themeability is not just for color, and share why I think a themeable design system will help you scale into the future.

Presented by Diana Mounter at Clarity 2021, on October 29th, 2021. Ends with an interview with Mina Markham.
