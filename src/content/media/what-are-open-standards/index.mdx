Open standards are one of the most powerful tools we have to open up government. They make it possible for the smallest supplier to compete with the largest. They make data open for any citizen to audit. They unlock the transformative power of open source software.

We have accomplished so much with open standards. Huge transformational programmes such as GOV.UK Verify, GOV.UK Pay, and the GOV.UK website are all backed by mature and scalable open standards. We are improving the way documents are generated, edited, and stored by adopting the Open Document Format (ODF).

Terence Eden, Open Standards Lead at the Government Digital Service and Jeni Tennison, CEO, Open Data Institute, talk about the importance of open standards.
