Converge is zeroheight’s one-day design systems conference. On September 21st, 2023, we hosted Converge UK in Manchester at the Stoller Hall! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.

Our Keynote speaker was Jina Anne (She/They) Clarity 

Design quality is essential to creating an excellent product user experience. It can be difficult to agree on what design quality means and how to achieve it, but with a design quality criteria in place, we can hold ourselves accountable and strive for excellence. In this session, Jina will share why it’s important to create a design quality criteria and give an example from their recent work. They’ll also share some insights into creating one so you can use this in your own organization!
