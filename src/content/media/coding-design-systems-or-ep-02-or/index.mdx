⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

This week, we start a new Tech Sample to demo Stitches by Modulz. We start implementing Stitches tokens: colors, spaces, fonts… We still use Dockit-react, the documentation framework made by ‹div›RIOTS, to power the documentation. Then we style a simple Button component with its variants by using the internal features of Stitches.
