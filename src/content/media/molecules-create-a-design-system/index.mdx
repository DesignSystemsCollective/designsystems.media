Episode 4: Molecules

In this session, I'll show how previously discussed Atomic Design system atoms scale to make more complex functional patterns - molecules. I'll show the key steps when it comes to this pattern morphing and highlight all caveats when working with UX and UI pattern libraries and design systems.

A design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer’s friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organisations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles.
