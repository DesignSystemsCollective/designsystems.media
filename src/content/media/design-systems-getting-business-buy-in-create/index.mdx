Episode 8: Design Systems: Getting Business Buy-in

In this video, I'll discuss the biggest issue that designers and engineers alike face when trying to introduce the very first atomic design system -- getting the buy-in from the business. Some designers don't even know where to start, others continuously struggle to convey design system value. There is one simple (not easy) workaround to conveying the value the businesses seek immediately. And it doesn't matter if you are using Sketch or Figma or what sort of organisation you're part of. If this is your first initiative with design systems - check the video. These principles will work for almost any design based initiative.

A design system is a collection of reusable product design components, that are guided by clear standards. Design system patterns are usually tested with end-users, thus can be easily assembled into new features. If properly set up, experimented, tested and maintained a well-defined system is one of the best designer’s friends. Furthermore, a living design system is one of the most important step-ups for mature designops and UX design organisations. This mini-series will cover exactly that: how to make a simple design system from scratch using Sketch and Atomic design principles.
