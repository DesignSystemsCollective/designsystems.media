⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

A11Y and Design Systems are made to work together: burning into the Design Systems A11Y fundamentals allow your teammates to build strong advanced UIs with confidence.

In thois episode, we talk about A11Y principles, their Devtools, how to manual test and automated things, as well as providing a great Developer Experience (DX) to allow your teammates to focus on what they do best: building strong interfaces. We code a simple top-level `nav` component illustrating A11Y-by-Design basics, and styling tricks based on `aria`.
