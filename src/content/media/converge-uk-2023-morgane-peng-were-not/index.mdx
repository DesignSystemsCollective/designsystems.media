Converge is zeroheight’s one-day design systems conference. On September 21st, 2023, we hosted Converge UK in Manchester at the Stoller Hall! Converge aims to bring together some of the brightest and best in design systems and design ops to discuss the challenges we face in taking design systems to the next level.

Morgane Peng (She/Her) Societe Generale

How do you ‘do’ Design Systems? Expectations are so high nowadays. Implement Design Tokens. Have a dedicated Design System team. Get a Design System manager. Wait, does your Design System even have a name?There isn’t one way to do Design Systems. Ours ticks none of these boxes, yet today, it allows us to build from the simplest to the most complex financial tools, and design systematically across our services. In this session, we’ll share the lessons we learned on prioritising impacts over grip.
