Andrew created the APCA color contrast specification that will be introduced in WCAG3. In this interview, we talk about how Andrew became interested in the topic and why APCA compliance is necessary for accessibility.

A new podcast where Kevin Muldoon and guests wrangle with the big common problems that design systems face. Every episode, they’ll hogtie a challenge, give it a good once over, and share the best techniques they’ve found to conquer them, from dealing with inconsistency to naming to white-label systems.
