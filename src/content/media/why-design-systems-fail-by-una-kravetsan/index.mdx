Design systems support a modular approach to building a product, promote organizational unity, and ensure stability via reusable code snippets and utility styles. They make prototyping a breeze, and provide a common language for both designers and developers. Are you making the most of your company’s design system? In this 60-minute presentation from An Event Apart Orlando 2018, Una Kravets explores what makes design systems successful, analyzes real examples of success and failure, and shows how to make sure your design system has the building blocks it needs to grow into a successful product.
