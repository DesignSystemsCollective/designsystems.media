Tasks like starting a business or learning to drive mean users have to find, understand and interact with government lots of times. By using end-to-end services, we can help users achieve their end task in a single journey. 

In multi-disciplinary teams, weâ€™ve built pages that lay out the complex journeys step-by-step. People understand what they need to do and when they need to do it.  

This work has made things simpler and clearer for people. Ben Carpenter, Inclusive Services Lead and Lou Downe,  Director of Design for the UK Government, talk about the importance of user-centred design.
