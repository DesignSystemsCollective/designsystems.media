The UK Government is a world-leading digital government. We recently produced the technology innovation in government survey which shows the extent and range of innovation activity across the whole of government. Emerging technologies considered include biometrics, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things and drones.

This video highlights some of the findings of the Innovation Survey.
