⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

With the concept of Islands Architecture, Astro brings a new way to think the Design of our applications. Offering a close-to-JSX syntax for its components, and natively supporting third-party UI frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte, it's a new generation of Static Site Generators.

In this episode, we welcome Matthew Phillips to discuss those new paradigms in Web sites/apps development, how it is chnaging the way we think our views, and how it aims to improve global performance. From a Design System perspective, we talk how we can use Design Tokens in Astro Components, and how we can use it to build static websites like documentation, straight with Astro files!
