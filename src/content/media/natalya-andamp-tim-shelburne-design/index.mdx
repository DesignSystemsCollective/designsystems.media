Why do we still hear about the gap between design and engineering, given that design systems exist? Because, like any other partnership, design systems take work. Natalya (designer!) and Tim (engineer...) have worked together for over a decade, and are still married!

This talk cuts through the noise to honestly and practically discuss working across disciplines, respecting the talents of your teammates, and enabling everyone to contribute to a common goal.

Presented by Nataya & Tim Shelburne at Clarity 2020, on September 3rd, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
