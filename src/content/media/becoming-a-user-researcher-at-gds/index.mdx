Everything starts with user needs: they are at the heart of the decisions we make at the Government Digital Service (GDS).

We employ teams of talented and committed user researchers to help us build a deep understanding of the people who use public services, so we can make sure they do the right thing. 

GDS user researchers use qualitative and quantitative methods to generate new insights that are put to work by our multidisciplinary teams (think: service managers, product managers, designers, developers and analysts) to iterate services and content and ultimately make things better for users.

Anna Kuforiji explains more about what life is like as a user researcher at GDS, and some of the key skills needed to succeed in this role.
