During the Into Design Systems 2024 conference, @samiam_designs shared with us a crash course in what a design token is and what makes a great name for a token.
This part was too valuable, we couldn't keep it in the vault!

The 'Into Design Systems' conference is a must-attend event for anyone serious about mastering design systems. I attended it over the past two years, and it has impacted my approach to design systems, especially on design tokens, providing me with actionable insights and techniques that I've successfully integrated into my daily work.   The conference is an investment in professional growth and an opportunity to connect with experts committed to excellence in design systems.
