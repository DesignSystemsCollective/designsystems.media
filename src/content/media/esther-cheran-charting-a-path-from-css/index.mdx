CSS Zen Garden sparked the imagination of designers and developers by allowing users to drastically change a webpage using a css stylesheet. What would a Token Zen Garden look like in the context of multi-brand design systems? And could we approach theming in a more visual way?

Presented by Esther Cheran at Clarity 2022, on November 10th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Sam Kapila.
