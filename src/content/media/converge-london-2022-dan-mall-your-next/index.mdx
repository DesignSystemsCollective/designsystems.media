The first ever ConvergeLDN took place on 21st September as part of World Design Systems Week. Hosted by us, zeroheight, we had some incredible experts talking all about design systems!

No matter where you are in your design system journey, your next component can make all the difference. Dan discusses the importance of choosing your next component and how that shouldnâ€™t be the easiest one. In fact, you should tackle the most challenging complex work first to make the future easier.
