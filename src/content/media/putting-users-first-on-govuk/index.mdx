Transforming digital services is about more than building websites. It's about making things better for users.

In government, we write user needs in the following way:
As a … (e.g. ‘self-employed person’)
I want to … (e.g. ‘file my tax return)
So that I can … (e.g. ‘avoid nasty fines’)

We work out who the audience is, then we look at what they want to do and why. Watch this video to see how we are working to meet user needs on GOV.UK. 


GOV.UK is the single online home for Government:https://www.gov.uk
