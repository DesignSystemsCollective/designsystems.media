Many inaccessible products still get shipped to users today. Often, devs get told they can "fix it later". Why fix it later, when you could build it right to start with? Great design documentation helps teams implement accessibility requirements. Let's talk about how designers can use this, to bake accessibility into the whole project, from the start!

Presented by Stéphanie Walter Hupe at Clarity 2022, on November 11th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Sam Kapila.
