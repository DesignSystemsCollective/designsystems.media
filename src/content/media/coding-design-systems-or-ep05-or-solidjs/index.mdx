This week we're pleased to welcome Ryan Carniato (@RyanCarniato) on the show! An occasion to talk about SolidJS Primitives and fundamentals, and creating a new Tech Sample Starter Kit for it in Backlight.

We discuss the reactivity mental model in SolidJS, the control flow, styling and handling CSS variables, supporting CSS Modules and MDX for documentation, and way more about the SolidJS ecosystem itself.
