Elaine Chao is a product manager at Adobe Systems, currently working on Adobe XD. Previously sheâ€™s worked as an engineer on a variety of products geared toward designers and web producers, including Dreamweaver, Edge Animate, and Creative Cloud. In this talk she discusses how design organizations around the world work, the problems they face in their workflows and what exactly design systems do for organizations, at awwwards conference San Francisco.

"Look at the industry today, we already have voice interactions in our cars, in our phones and in our homes, and as we look in the near future - things like VR and AR. Our interaction models are changing rapidly, technology has to change and so your design systems have to be these living breathing things that reflect the industry."
