Design systems are an investment. It takes time and resources to build and maintain them. When your team is small, investing in design systems can seem unnecessary or feel like a luxury you can't afford. Many companies don't employ people to focus on design systems until the inefficiencies of not having one become too painful to bear.

I'll share examples from building design systems at GitHub, show you how this can improve the design and development workflow, and help you to understand when you need to start building design systems and how much of a system you might need.
