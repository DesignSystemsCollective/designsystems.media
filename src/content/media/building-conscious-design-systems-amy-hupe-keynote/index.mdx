The theme for Design System Day 2022 was ‘Inclusivity by Design’, and to open our event, we welcomed Amy Hupe, a UK-based design systems and content design consultant. Amy spoke to us about ‘Building conscious design systems’.

For the past 6 years, Amy has worked on design systems for some of the biggest names around, including GOV.UK, BT, Springer Nature and Babylon Health.

Whether she’s leading systems work or designing content, Amy works to champion simplicity and inclusion in the face of complexity.
