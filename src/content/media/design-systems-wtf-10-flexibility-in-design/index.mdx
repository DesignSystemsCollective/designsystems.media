Flexibility – Are you being too prescriptive in your design system?

In this episode, we tackle the common concern—are you being too prescriptive with your design system? We’ll discuss the fine line between guidance and rigidity, exploring how much prescription is too much. We’ll share the pitfalls of being overly prescriptive and the chaos that can ensue from excessive flexibility. 

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
