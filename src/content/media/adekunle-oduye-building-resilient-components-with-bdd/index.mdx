Some brands have very loyal customers due to their product’s being reliable and having a high quality level. This is the same when constructing design system components that designers and engineers use everyday when building features. You not only need to make sure they’re functional and align to the product's aesthetics, but they also have to be performant, accessible and scalable. Having buggy components will decrease confidence for the design system.

One way to minimize bugs in components is to use a BDD approach. Behavior Driven Development (BDD) is a programming style where tests are created from the user’s perspective before code is written. But what are the most effective ways to implement BDD when building components? How can BDD be beneficial to developers and also designers, researchers and QA?

The audience will learn:

- The benefits of BDD and TDD
- Techniques on how to implement BDD into a design system process
- How to leverage automating testing while building components

Presented by Adekunle Oduye at Clarity 2021, on October 28th, 2021. Ends with an interview with Mina Markham.
