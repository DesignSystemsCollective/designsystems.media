This is a bit of an experiment: a short intro video with some thoughts around a topic to hopefully start a conversation. I'll try a few, as awkward as they are to make to see if it works!

This time, I wanted to build from our problem space and start thinking about how we know we're solving that problem. Not yet into specific metrics but how do we know our system is successful?
