A zeroheight series, Design System Discussions is a chance for us to gather the brightest minds in design systems and design system documentation to discuss pressing issues that face us as design orgs with our design system implementation.

From adoption to measurement to documentation to contribution, each panel is designed to answer your questions on how to make your design system the best it can be.

According to the Sparkbox Design System Survey 2021, adoption is one of the biggest problems facing design systems teams across the world. Optimizing your system for adoption, avoiding common pitfalls and defining what good adoption is are all on the table for our expert panel in our first webinar event.
