This time, Amy and Geri are talking all about Figma UI kits!

Are you a real design system without a Figma UI kit? Does it need to be a pixel-perfect copy of your code? What’s the source of truth? More pressingly, can a Figma library BE your design system? 

Design system consultants Amy Hupe and Geri Reid are going back to design systems school.

In this series, Amy and Geri put aside their vocal and opinionated assumptions to dive deep on design systems topics; from Figma libraries to design tokens to deciding if AI can really write decent documentation. Climb aboard the school bus for a field trip on the history, the conversations and the foundations that really make a design system great.
