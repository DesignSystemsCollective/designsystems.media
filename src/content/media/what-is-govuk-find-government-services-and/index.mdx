GOV.UK is the single website for all central government services and information. It launched in 2012 and replaced nearly 2,000 government websites. 

GOV.UK has been viewed more than 14 billion times since it went live. It gets an average 3.6 million visits a day. It has won awards and it has influenced governments all over the world from Australia to Israel.

But GOV.UK is much more than just a website for government - itâ€™s the digital interface for millions of people interacting with central government.
