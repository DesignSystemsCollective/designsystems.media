👩🏻‍💻 Designing a Design System
Product Design for web and mobile is evolving at a fast pace. As the range of devices and platforms continues to expand, so do the various design considerations. Design systems help a design team build a framework that meets their needs by bringing together all of the critical design components - including style guides, pattern and UI libraries, CSS frameworks and other resources. In this session, Jina, a Lead Designer on the Design Systems team at Salesforce UX, will share: - Strategies for how to approach, design and build an effective design system - How to successfully maintain the system to ensure ongoing usefulness - Elements that design systems need to be sustainable that are critical for success

Designers and developers share a common mission - to create amazing experiences. But it's not always easy for these two tribes to communicate. To bridge the gap between design and technology, we created the Front Conference in 2011.

To create great digital products, we rely on each other: designers on developers and developers on designers. That's why we came up with the idea of a conference for everyone involved in the design and implementation of a front end.

By staying at the forefront of both design and technology, we've grown to become the largest web conference in Switzerland. Our interests have broadened to reflect the increasing maturity of the industry. We now cover management topics such as design leadership, tech governance and UX strategy.

Our attendees range from juniors to managers, and we attract key speakers to come to Zurich and share their knowledge in talks and workshops. 

The conference has become a place to learn and network, and we have many loyal professionals who come back every year.
