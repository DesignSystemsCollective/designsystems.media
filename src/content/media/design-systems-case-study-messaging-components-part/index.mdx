I’ve been working at Wealthsimple as a Senior Product Designer, and during my time there, I have been on the design platform team, which means that I’ve been able to contribute to the design systems as well as to some platform-level work that would touch across the Wealthsimple eco-system.

Check out part one of the case study of the project that I have recently shipped. Enjoy!
