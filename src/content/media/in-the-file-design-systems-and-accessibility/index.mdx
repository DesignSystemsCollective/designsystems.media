Join Luis from Figma and Daniel Henderson-Ede to talk all things accessibility with components, variables, and design at scale. Daniel is an accessibility expert and has contributed to the CVS accessibility kit, now used by companies, and has inspired new kits from Github, to document how components can be used and handed off to development teams.

During the livestream, they pull back the curtain on Daniel’s experience, providing you with insights into what accessibility looks like within design systems teams, with tonnes of tips and tricks on how to get started within your own. They'll provide advice for design system maintainers, design system consumers with a discussion about challenges with and requirements of designing accessible interfaces.
