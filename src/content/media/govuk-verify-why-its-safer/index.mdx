GOV.UK Verify is a secure way to prove who you are online. Central storage of information is not safe or secure, so Verify does it differently.

Companies and organisations normally use databases to store people's information. Big databases are vulnerable to attack. If someone gets access to a central database, they have access to everything.

Verify works differently. When you use Verify, your information is not stored in a central database.

You choose a company to verify your identity. The company makes a series of checks with different sources to make sure it's you before you use a government service.

No one has all the information, and there is no central storage. It keeps your identity and information secure.

GOV.UK Verify. Safer, simpler services online.
