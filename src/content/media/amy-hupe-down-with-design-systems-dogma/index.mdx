“If you’re not doing design systems like this, you’re doing it wrong”. Sound familiar?

Establishing and running design systems has never felt more like a strict set of criteria to meet. But what are we missing out as we become more rigid about how we define and practice design systems? And what value might lie in loosening our grip?

In this talk, Amy explores the impact of dogmatism in the field of design systems, and the opportunities a more flexible approach might bring.

Presented by Amy Hupe at Clarity 2022, on November 10th, 2022. Ends with an interview with Sam Kapila.
