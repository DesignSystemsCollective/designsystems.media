In this episode of The Question, we dive into the differences between product design and systems design. If you work on design systems or digital products of any kind, the distinction between these roles is critical to understand. Unfortunately,  many organizations are leaving this distinction to chance. Michell and I facilitate a deep dive into the nuances between the roles and the ways we can begin to recognize the differences to lead to higher quality digital products.
