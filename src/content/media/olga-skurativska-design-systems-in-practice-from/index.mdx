👩🏻‍💻 Design Systems in Practice - From Sketch to Production
UX designers dream up elegant design systems, but it's engineers that create the end product. What tools, artefacts, practices and processes do you need to keep shipping consistent user experience? What challenges await the organisations introducing design systems for the first time? Here is a story of how good engineering practices changed the way products are designed and built at Homegate.

Designers and developers share a common mission - to create amazing experiences. But it's not always easy for these two tribes to communicate. To bridge the gap between design and technology, we created the Front Conference in 2011.

To create great digital products, we rely on each other: designers on developers and developers on designers. That's why we came up with the idea of a conference for everyone involved in the design and implementation of a front end.

By staying at the forefront of both design and technology, we've grown to become the largest web conference in Switzerland. Our interests have broadened to reflect the increasing maturity of the industry. We now cover management topics such as design leadership, tech governance and UX strategy.

Our attendees range from juniors to managers, and we attract key speakers to come to Zurich and share their knowledge in talks and workshops. 

The conference has become a place to learn and network, and we have many loyal professionals who come back every year.
