This special episode is our love letter to the unsung heroes of the design system world. We shine a spotlight on some incredible individuals in the field who might not be on your radar yet, but definitely should be. We’ll share our personal favorites, diving into the work they’re doing and where you can find their contributions. Get ready to fall in love with these design system Valentines. 

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
