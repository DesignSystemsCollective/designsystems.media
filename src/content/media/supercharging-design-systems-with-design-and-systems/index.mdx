Supercharging design systems involves blending Design Thinking and Systems Thinking for a holistic approach. While both methods emphasize problem-solving, Design Thinking zooms in on user experience, whereas Systems Thinking considers the broader context. By integrating both, teams can build robust design systems that are user-focused yet adaptable to organizational and systemic complexities.
