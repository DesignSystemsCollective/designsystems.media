In this 90-minute workshop, the GOV.UK Design System team demonstrates how they test components and patterns for accessibility. The workshop uses the upcoming task-list component as an example.

The Design System team is increasingly working alongside its community to develop new components and patterns. One such example is the task-list co-design project. You can learn more about community initiatives on the GOV.UK Design System community page.

This workshop was run twice; on the 1st and 8th of March 2023.
