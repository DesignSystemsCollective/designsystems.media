Just as there’s no one way to make a website, there is no one way to make a design system. While there are several “best practices” that have emerged, there is no one-size-fits-all solution for creating a design system. And sometimes, the best solution means going against industry standards.

In this talk, Mina will discuss her experiences building systems at two highly visible, and vastly different, organizations: Hillary for America and Slack. She’ll tell you all the things and all the ways she got it wrong, while somehow making it work.

Presented by Mina Markham at Clarity 2017, on November 28th, 2017. Ends with an interview with Una Kravets
