As design system maintainers, we want to make sure that our primitive variables are created but never surfaced in the properties panel.

To do this, we can firstly descope them, and secondly make sure they are not selected for publishing.

This works if your primitive and semantic variables exist within the same file. If they don't, make sure you publish them! Otherwise, you will not be able to use them as aliases within your semantic variables.
