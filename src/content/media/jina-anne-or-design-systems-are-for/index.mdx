Design systems grew out of a need to build consistent, cohesive visual experiences across devices and platforms, and to centralize and consolidate design efforts. While they create a better user experience, increase the efficiency of teams, and improve the quality of products, design systems need to be more than just inventories and deliverables if they are to be successful. Jina will share her thoughts on using design systems to empower and strengthen your creativity while still keeping its goals of scale, maintainability, and efficiency at heart.

She’s also worked at GitHub, Engine Yard, Crush + Lovely, and Memphis Brooks Museum of Art, and more. She developed projects with W3C, Mass.gov, FedEx, and more.
