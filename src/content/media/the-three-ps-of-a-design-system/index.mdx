This talk was recorded at Craft Conference 2022. Adekunle Oduye from Plaid company spoke about design system and product design. Building a design system that scales is hard. You have to get stakeholder buy-in and then establish a style guide and then build out a UI components library and then develop a voice and tone that captures the brand and and and... There’s so much to do! That can fuel envy when we look at popular design systems on the web and say, “We want to have something like that.” But how do we get there? What are the specific steps we can take to build a successful design system? A world-class design system will not only allow teams to build scalable products today, but also lay the foundation for future innovations. Done right, it will provide engineers with production ready UI components and enable designers to craft front-end prototypes. Learn about the three Ps and how it can help you achieve these goals. In this talk, audience will learn: - How to identify and prioritize the users of your design system - The process of building a design system from the ground up - How to setup a design system to serve multiple use cases
