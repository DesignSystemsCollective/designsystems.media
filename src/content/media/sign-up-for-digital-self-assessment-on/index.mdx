A new digital service allows you to fill in and send your self assessment tax return to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) online, without the need to fill out paper forms. 

Users can also go back to a tax return theyâ€™ve already started, 
check their details, view returns and print their tax calculations. 

You can now sign up for paperless Digital Self Assessment at: https://www.gov.uk/log-in-file-self-assessment-tax-return
