Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK.

SPEAKER:
Michelle Chin and Luke Murphy
Design Advocates, zeroheight
(Day 2/2, talk 05)

TALK: DESIGN SYSTEMS WTF - LIVE PODCAST
Design Systems WTF is a podcast featuring Luke Murphy and Michelle Chin.

Michelle (she/her) is a Design Advocate at zeroheight, where she serves the design community through knowledge sharing, building bridges, and identifying community needs. She has worn several hats, from product designer to design manager to design ops manager. She leads the DEI committee at zeroheight and career coaches underrepresented communities in tech. She also cohosts several design-related podcasts and runs a meetup called Hella Design Systems. As an environmental justice advocate, she works to provide tree equity in Oakland, California.

Luke (they/them) currently leads the Marketing team at zeroheight. Before zeroheight, Luke has worked as an IC and leader in product design and advocacy teams at Memrise, Mr & Mrs Smith and Microsoft. They co-host too many podcasts and co-organize WDC conference. When they’re not shouting about design systems and designops, they are busy raising their 11 year old son, shouting in a queer punk band or telling the world why Josie and the Pussycats is a criminally underrated film.

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
