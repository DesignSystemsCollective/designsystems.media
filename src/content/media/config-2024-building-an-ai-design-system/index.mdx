Config 2024: Building an AI design system at scale (Phillip Maggs, Creative Director, Superside)

In this talk, Phillip will lift the hood on how Superside has built an AI design system at a scale thatâ€™s utterly unique, giving them the ability to handle massive volumes of design needs across critical marketing channels. Speaking primarily to designers, but with applications and interest areas for product managers, developers, and engineers, this session will give the audience the foundational components they need to build this type of system for themselves.

Featuring: Phillip Maggs, Creative Director, Superside
