⎯⎯⎯ Description ⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯⎯

When talking about reusability and extensibility, you would always bet on standards. Fortunately, this is what Web Components are committed to being! By building your low-level, design systems components with Web Components, you may ensure a wide range of compatibility with your final apps frameworks. That’s what we cover in this episode: empowering the DX using advanced standards.
