The Design System Canvas helps bring structure to the creation or updating of a design system. It’s a one-page plan of your vision for a design system, and acts as the perfect starting point for the process of creating or upgrading a design system. Throughout the process, it acts as a single source of truth and serves as a living artefact to refer back to.
