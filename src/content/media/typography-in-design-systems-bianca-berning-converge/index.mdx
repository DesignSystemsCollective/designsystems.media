Converge is zeroheight’s annual design systems conference. In 2024 we hosted a two-day, single-track event in Brighton, UK. 

SPEAKER: 
Bianca Berning
Staff Typographer, Spotify
(Day 1/2, talk 07)

TALK: TYPOGRAPHY IN DESIGN SYSTEMS
Typography is at the heart of a cohesive user experience, especially when designing for a global audience. Join Bianca as she delves into how Encore, Spotifys Design system, leverages variable fonts for performance, while ensuring Spotify’s typography is expressive, accessible, and culturally relevant across 74 languages and 192 markets.

CONVERGE 2024
At Converge '24, we embraced a theme that extended beyond the functional boundaries of design systems—inspiring excellence in design systems. We explored the dynamic ways teams are scoring wins with their design systems. Looking ahead, we also heard about emerging trends and potential strategies that could further elevate our work.
