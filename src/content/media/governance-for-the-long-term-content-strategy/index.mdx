Content Strategy Seattle Meetup recording of March 15, 2023 event

Design systems offer content creators, designers, marketers, and other enterprise content owners ways to control the interaction and look and feel of elements—and gain consistency in exchange for some creative control. Good for the content, and good for the people who need to approve the content, right? By including content strategy, design systems become more comprehensive, taking an experience from good to great. But we need to change how we collaborate to make that process successful—and sustainable. Come learn how we can shift the conversation and address publishing culture throughout the process to ensure successful rollout, adoption, and ongoing use.
