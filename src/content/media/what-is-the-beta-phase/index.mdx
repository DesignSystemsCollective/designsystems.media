The objective of the beta phase in agile development is to build a working version of the service based on your alpha prototypes.

Private beta: A private beta is a beta that isn’t open to everyone. You must restrict access. You shouldn’t launch your service publicly in private beta - make it invite-only or launch it in a limited region.

Public beta: A public beta is a version of your service that’s available for any member of the public to use.

You must pass your beta service assessment before you launch your service into public beta.
