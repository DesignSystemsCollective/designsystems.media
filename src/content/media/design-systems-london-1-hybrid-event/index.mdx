We are so excited to announce that DSL is back - this time with our first in-person event since our last conference back in late 2019!

This edition of our meetup will take place in London, but we will also livestream it to our DSL Youtube channel; this way you can join us from wherever you are!

We are always thrilled to see all the familiar faces, but also some new ones, and of course some new speakers joining our community. If you would like to give a talk during our upcoming meetup or any other future events, check out our speaker form. If you know someone who you think might be a good speaker, please feel free to pass on the form to them.
