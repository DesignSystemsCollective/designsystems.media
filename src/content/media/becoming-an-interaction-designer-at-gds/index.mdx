Design roles at the Government Digital Service (GDS) fall under 3 specialisms: 

- service designers who design what the things should be
- interaction designers who design how things should work
- graphic designers who explain what the thing does

As interaction designer Jeremy Yun explains, GDS designers collaborate with digital teams across government to make joined-up services that work for users. 

The patterns and tools we create are used by other designers working on public services all over the world, and have been recognised and awarded by the Design Museum, D&AD and IXDA.
