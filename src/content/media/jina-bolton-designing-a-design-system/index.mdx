Product Design for web and mobile is evolving at a fast pace. As the range of devices and platforms continues to expand, so do the various design considerations. Design systems help a design team build a framework that meets their needs by bringing together all of the critical design components - including style guides, pattern and UI libraries, CSS frameworks and other resources.

In this session, Jina, a Lead Designer on the Design Systems team at Salesforce UX, will share:

- Strategies for how to approach, design and build an effective design system
- How to successfully maintain the system to ensure ongoing usefulness
- Elements that design systems need to be sustainable that are critical for success
