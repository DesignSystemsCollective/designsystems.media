Creating a color system for a large scale corporation is every designer’s dream but comes with its fair share of problems. If we take that process and intertwine accessibility we can eliminate a lot of those difficult decisions and create something truly beautiful. By the end of my talk, I want to empower other designers to take a fresh look at their own design systems and how they too can create an a11y-forward color system.

This session is from the Design track.
