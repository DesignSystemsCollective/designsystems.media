The language we use to describe effective design systems seems so similar to the language we use to describe how effective teams work.

“Authentic and genuine principles”, “a shared language”, “clear channels of communication”, “clear governance structures”, “frequent checkups”.

See what I mean? Read any decent article or book on effective design systems or effective teams and these 👆🏾 concepts are gonna come up. Why? Because a team is also a system. It’s just that we don’t think of it that way, because its “people stuff”. So we avoid it. Because “people stuff” is “hard”.

I’d like to convince you otherwise. In this talk I’ll share practical tips on how any team can become more effective when it thinks of itself as a system. Not only that, I’ll show how to do this using some of the core principles and techniques we already know, love, and use to build effective design systems.

You don’t have to be a lead or a manager to make your team more inclusive and effective. You just need to care about design, systems, and people. That’s why you’re here right?

Presented by Farai Madzima at Clarity 2020, on September 4th, 2020. Ends with an interview with Dan Mall.
