In this talk, Cíntia will cover three things:

- Her experience working as a color-blind designer working with design systems at Pinterest
- Share about the accessibility training for designers she built on Pinterest and how other companies can do the same
- How to design systems can set inclusive design principles and contribute to a more accessible product

This session was in the Design Track.
