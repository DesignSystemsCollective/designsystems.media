Contribution often seems like the perfect solution for scaling design systems, but is it really? We'll weigh the tough realities of managing contributions and why a federated system might not suit everyone. We'll explore the hurdles of contribution and how to decide if it's the right path for your team.

A podcast from zeroheight. Letâ€™s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
