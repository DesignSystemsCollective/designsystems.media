Design systems provide companies a tremendous amount of value, eliminating inconsistency, time spent on design, development, improving user experience and so much more. The question is, how can you measure its impact? How can you show the value a Design System is creating?

A zeroheight series, Design System Discussions is a chance for us to gather the brightest minds in design systems and design system documentation to discuss pressing issues that face us as design orgs with our design system implementation.

From adoption to measurement to documentation to contribution, each panel is designed to answer your questions on how to make your design system the best it can be.
