Hello friend! This video is part 2 of a series where I walk you through a case study from my time at Wealthsimple. If you haven't watched part 1 yet, I highly recommend checking it here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYp3_dKPbEE&ab_channel=femke.design

## In this video, we'll dive straight into the Figma file and look at how I created, set up and documented the components for this project. Enjoy!
