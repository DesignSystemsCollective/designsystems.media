Config 2025: Figma's conference for people who build products

Strong designer-developer collaboration is crucial for successful design systems, but aligning motivations, incentives, and skills can be challenging. In this talk, Figma’s Chad Bergman and Jake Albaugh will share best practices for breaking silos, aligning on intent, and creating a shared language to improve designer and developer collaboration from ideation to handoff when building a cohesive design system, together.

Featuring: Jake Albaugh, Designer Advocate, Figma & Chad Bergman, Designer Advocate, Figma
