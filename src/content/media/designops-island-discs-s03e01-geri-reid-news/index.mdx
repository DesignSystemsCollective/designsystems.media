DesignOps Island Discs is a live-recorded, interactive podcast from @zeroheight9269 looking at what's coming up in the world of designops and design systems. For season three, we're focussing on the roles that make up designops and design systems, from content designers to leads to engineers to accessibility specialists to DPMs.

For our first episode, we welcome Geri Reid, lead designer on Newskit, the News UK design system. We'll talk about what a lead designer does in the context of design systems, the challenges, what could change, and when you might think about hiring your first lead designer.
