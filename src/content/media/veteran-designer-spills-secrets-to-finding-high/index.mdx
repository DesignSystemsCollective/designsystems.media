Designers: I want to help you make more money.

I‚Äôve run a 7-figure ARR agency and do high 6-figures every year as an independent consultant, all working about 30 to 50 hours a week. I know a thing or two about making money, and I‚Äôd love to tell you everything.

Here‚Äôs a recording of a big Zoom meeting I had with 245 friends talking about things like:

‚Ä¢ ‚ÄãDifficulty finding clients
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄãKnowing what to charge
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄãMaking the jump to freelance
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄãCreating offers
‚Ä¢ ‚ÄãWarm vs. cold outreach
