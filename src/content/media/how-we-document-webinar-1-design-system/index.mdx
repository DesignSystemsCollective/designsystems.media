Design system documentation has been maturing at a rapid pace over the last five years. how we document is an opportunity for us to stop, reflect and figure out the biggest challenges that face us in how we document and grow our design systems.

In this webinar, our panel talks all about what makes a happy design systems team with zeroheight's very own Luke Murphy and Michelle Chin and the incredible Dan Mall. They answer questions from what’s the right size for a design system team to what’s essential for a team’s happiness.

The How We Document survey was conducted from Sep to Oct 2021 across social media, industry Slack channels, and emails to design system professionals.
