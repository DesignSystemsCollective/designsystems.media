On 29 January 2014, Sprint 14 marked the halfway point in our 400 days to transform government services, making digital services that people choose to use.

People from around the country got together to take stock, compare notes, and focus on the important work ahead.

This is a film of some of the day's highlights, including ministers rolling up their sleeves to demo digital services live on the stage.
