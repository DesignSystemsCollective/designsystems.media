Should Figma be the source of truth?

Figma is currently dominating the design landscape, and with good reason. They’ve taken what we’ve done with product and UX design and allowed us to do so much more than we used to be able to. With the release and continued improvement of Dev Mode, they’re hoovering up more use cases and raising the question: are we happy with a design tool being the source of truth for all product teams?

A podcast from zeroheight. Let’s be honest, design systems are full of choice wtf moments. Michelle and Luke, two of our resident design advocates, are attempting to combat this with a new regular series, where they answer a single question about design system troubles every two weeks.
