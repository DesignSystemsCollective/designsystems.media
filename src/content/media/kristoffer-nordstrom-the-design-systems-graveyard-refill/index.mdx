Building a Design System is easy, maintaining and making it grow organically is much more difficult. This requires planning and collaboration, or does it? Can't we just cut out the collaboration part and make things more efficient? What does all this have in common with The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning? Join me on a story about planning, categorising and sorting and about handling human beings and their peculiarities. Maybe your Design System will end up on The Design Systems Graveyard.

This talk was held at Refill 2025 in Stockholm.
