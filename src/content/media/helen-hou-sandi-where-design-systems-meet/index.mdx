Design systems aren't just for software and product teams—they're for content websites, too. But it's one thing to come up with a design system for a website, and another to translate it for the people who manage the content that goes into your carefully crafted design system. They say software is eating the world, but I would venture to say that even more people are involved in the care and maintenance of websites, and it's important that they're remembered as the standards rise ever higher.

Let's explore some strategies for translating parts of a design system for editorial needs - the functional spec, if you will - and take a look at some real-world examples of how powerful that can be in a visual editing experience in a popular CMS.

Presented by Helen Hou-Sandi at Clarity 2021, on October 27th, 2021. Ends with an interview with Mina Markham.
