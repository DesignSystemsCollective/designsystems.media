When your type and color say one thing, but your use of animation says another, things can get confusing. Defining how your brand should express itself in motion gives you the “why” of your UI animation efforts, and establishes a concrete way to ensure your UI animations share a common thread both with each other, and with the rest of your design efforts.

In this session, Val will show you how to harness the design details of UI animation to reinforce your intended design messaging. By using every tool at our disposal, we can create more expressive products that feel cohesive across all of today's diverse contexts.

Presented by Marcy Sutton at Clarity 2019, on August 20th, 2019. Ends with an interview with Brad Frost.
