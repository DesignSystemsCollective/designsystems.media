GOV.UK is the digital home for the UK government. It’s the digital interface between the people and their government - it’s essential for anyone who wants to live or work in the UK. 

It first went live in 2012, and since then it’s received billions of page views with millions of people visiting daily. Whether you want to look up lockdown guidance, check your state pension or buy a fishing licence, it’s all on GOV.UK. 

We’ve got a vision for GOV.UK to provide joined up, trusted and personalised interactions for its users. Watch the video to find out more about GOV.UK’s ambitious plans.
