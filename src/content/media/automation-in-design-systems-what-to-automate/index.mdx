This is an in-depth look at automation in design systems, including how to automate processes like project management and design token delivery.

In this webinar, we discuss when automation becomes a no-brainer and, more importantly, what tools teams can use to automate quickly. If youâ€™ve been wondering how to leverage no-code tools like Zapier or design token management to help your team work faster, we hope you'll enjoy!
