Language shapes the way we think and structure the world we build. On this episode of _The Design Systems Podcast_, Chris Strahl sits down with Ben Callahan, co-founder of Sparkbox, to explore the critical role of language and communication in team dynamics, problem-solving, and system structures. Ben shares insights on how linguistic choices shape product creation and drive organization-wide cohesion. He argues that while common ground is essential, design systems should balance order with controlled "quenched disorder" to foster innovation, using flexible, layered structures that adapt to unique team needs and create scalable, culturally embedded solutions. Listen to the full episode to gain a deeper understanding of the intricate relationship between language, design systems, and organizational culture, as well as practical insights on fostering system adoption and cross-team collaboration.
