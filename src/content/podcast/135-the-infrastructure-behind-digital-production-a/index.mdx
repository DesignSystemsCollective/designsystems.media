Design systems aren’t just a UI toolkit—they’re the backbone of digital product creation and management. In this episode, engineer and researcher Steve Dodier-Lazaro joins Chris Strahl to unpack why treating design systems like standalone products is holding teams back. They explore what it really takes to scale product design and development in enterprise environments—from shared tooling and token standards to how AI and LLMs can bridge messy, real-world workflows.

In this episode:

-   Why design systems are _dependencies_, not deliverables
-   Tools and standards shaping the future of digital production
-   How AI will reshape the infrastructure behind design and engineering
