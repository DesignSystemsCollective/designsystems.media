**Guest  
**Professionally, I express myself through creating new products and businesses, both for myself and others. My first business was designing and printing t-shirts in my parent's garage at 14-yrs old.  
  
Since then I’ve been fortunate enough to play either a founding or leadership role in several companies. To share what I've learned, I speak at conferences, run workshops, write articles, books and am a regular guest on industry podcasts.
