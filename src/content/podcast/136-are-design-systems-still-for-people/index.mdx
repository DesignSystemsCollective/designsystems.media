In this episode, Chris Strahl talks with Elyse Holladay—staff design engineer at Color Health and host of _On Theme_—about the evolution of design systems and how AI is reshaping the way we think about abstraction, collaboration, and contribution. They explore what it means to maintain relevance in a landscape where LLMs increasingly influence product development, and reflect on whether design systems are still for people—or for machines. Elyse shares a clear-eyed yet optimistic take on how AI can enhance, rather than replace, the work of design system practitioners.

Key Points:

-   Design systems are shifting focus from components to solving collaboration and workflow problems.
-   AI isn’t replacing systems—it’s changing how they’re used and what they need to support.
-   Smaller teams can move faster by focusing on what’s most valuable, not doing everything.
-   Documentation is evolving to prioritize practical guidance over polished presentations.
-   Design systems are becoming infrastructure for both humans and AI.
