We tackle a question that often gets overlooked in the world of design systems: Is there room for fun and delight? Sure, components are the workhorses of design systems, known for their functionality and consistency, but does that mean they have to be dull? Weâ€™ll explore the possibilities of infusing a bit of charm and personality into your design system. Listen in as we discuss examples of some of the more fun design systems in action, the challenges of maintaining usability while injecting creativity, and how to strike the right balance.
