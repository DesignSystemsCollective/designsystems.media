What does it take to transform 121 years of automotive legacy into a modern digital ecosystem? Catherine Dubut, Director of Global UX Strategy at Ford Pro, joins Chris Strahl to share how her team is reengineering the organization’s fragmented product landscape into a scalable, unified digital assembly line.

With over 80 legacy sites, 20+ global markets, and deeply siloed teams, the scale and complexity of Ford Pro’s challenge was immense. Catherine explains how her team brought structure to chaos—combining elements from outdated systems, building new foundations where needed, and stitching them together into a single, coherent design system. From establishing governance and cross-functional collaboration to introducing micro frontends and scaling adoption, this episode offers a playbook for modernizing UX at enterprise scale.

Key themes:

-   Designing for fleets, not just drivers—multiple users, journeys, and roles per customer
-   Replatforming 80+ tools across legacy systems and international business units
-   Building a design system through consolidation, extension, and future-proofing
-   Using micro frontends to bridge disparate tech stacks across Ford Pro
-   Measuring success through design efficiency, team adoption, and developer alignment
