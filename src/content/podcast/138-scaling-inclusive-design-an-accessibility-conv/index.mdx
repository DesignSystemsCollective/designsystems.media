How do teams turn accessibility from individual effort into system wide practice? Chris talks with Anna Thielke, founder and CEO of Mantis and Company, to find out. They explore why representation on system teams leads to better standards, how designing for the edges strengthens products for everyone, and what it takes for accessibility work to spread across large organizations in a sustainable way. Anna also shares how lived experience shapes her perspective and why accessibility becomes more effective when teams view it as shared responsibility rather than a late stage requirement.

**Key Takeaways**

-   Design systems provide the structure needed to scale accessibility across teams.
-   Representation on system teams shapes the standards that reach every product.
-   Designing for the edges leads to more inclusive and resilient experiences.
