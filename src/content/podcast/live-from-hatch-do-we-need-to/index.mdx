In this episode, we’re challenging the status quo of design systems by questioning the necessity of components. Are we too focused on building and maintaining a library of components when we should be thinking bigger? What if our obsession with components is actually holding back innovation? Join us as we explore whether it’s time to shift our attention away from components and consider new ways to build flexibility, scalability, and creativity into our design systems.
