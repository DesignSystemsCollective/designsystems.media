Your hapless co-hosts Dan & Dan take one step into the unknown, creating a podcast!  
  
Our first guinea pig/guest is Geri Reid from NewsKit, talking about everything from her experience in design systems, education, whether she's a tea or coffee drinker, and, more importantly, what she'd do if the Internet disappeared tomorrow. Don't worry...we asked about her choice of biscuit too.

Got a suggestion for another guest or want to lavish untold amounts of praise for our ramblings? Give us a follow on the bird site [@WhatTheDS](https:%20//twitter.com/WhatTheDS)
