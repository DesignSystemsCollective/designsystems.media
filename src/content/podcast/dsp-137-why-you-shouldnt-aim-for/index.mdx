If you’ve ever struggled to balance perfection with business reality, this episode is for you. In this episode of the Design Systems Podcast, Chris Strahl talks with Noelle Lansford, founder of _Shep_, about why chasing the “perfect system” often breaks more than it fixes. Drawing on her experience across startups and Fortune 5 companies, Noelle argues that design systems succeed when they serve people and the business—not when they chase architectural purity. She and Chris dig into the realities of relational alignment between design, engineering, and product, the shift from component factories to consulting mindsets, and what AI means for the next generation of design leadership.

Here’s what stood out:

-   Perfection shouldn’t be your goal
-   Design systems teams should pursue an infrastructure + enablement structure
-   Systems of systems thinking works—if the cultural conditions are right
-   AI makes iteration faster, which makes human oversight more essential

**Guest**

[**Noelle Lansford**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noellelansford/) began her career as an engineer on design system teams before transitioning into design, where she discovered her passion for connecting the technical and human sides of digital product creation. Today, as the founder of [**Shep**](https://www.linkedin.com/company/howdyshep/), a design systems consultancy that partners with organizations from early-stage startups to Fortune 5 companies, Noelle helps bridge the gap between design, engineering, and business strategy.
