My [very first minisode](https://www.buzzsprout.com/2417527/episodes/16373923) of the entire podcast was some 2025 predictions, and a _lot_ has changed. (Honestly, what was I thinking trying to make predictions in the era of AI? fml) [Noelle Lansford](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noellelansford/) joined me for Season Two's official first episode to  recap my 2025 predictions with me and look back on the trends and themes we saw in design-systems-land last year.

Stay tuned for part two where we dive in to our 2026 predictions!
