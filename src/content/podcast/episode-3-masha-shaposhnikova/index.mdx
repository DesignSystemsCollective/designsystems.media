Wandering through the wealth of great content that people share about design systems, we stumbled across [this piece by Masha on Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/12/taking-stress-out-design-system-management/)...so we thought we'd invite her onto the show to talk about being a hybrid designer-developer type person, working in design systems as a team of one and her next challenge. Food came into it, too...so now we know her favorite pizza!
