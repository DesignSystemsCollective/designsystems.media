In this episode, we tackle the common concern—are you being too prescriptive with your design system? We’ll discuss the fine line between guidance and rigidity, exploring how much prescription is too much. We’ll share the pitfalls of being overly prescriptive and the chaos that can ensue from excessive flexibility.
