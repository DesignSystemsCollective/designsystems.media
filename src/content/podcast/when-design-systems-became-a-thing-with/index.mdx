**Jina Anne gives us a history of the journey from early style guides to widespread industry adoption of design systems**, and the challenges and successes. We explore how tokens came to be, how it feels when the engineering team just starts using your work before it's ready, the separation of HTML/CSS/JS concerns, and how ClarityConf got started. Plus, the origin of the phrase "design systems" (maybe?), and¬† what the NASA Graphic Standards Manual has to do with ClarityConf.
