[Vojtech Miksu](https://twitter.com/vmiksu) (Software Engineer at Uber) and [Evan Lovely](https://twitter.com/evanlovely) (Chief Architect at Knapsack) join [Chris](https://twitter.com/chrisstrahl) to discuss the gap between a frontend developerâ€™s code base and what actually gets shipped, the next-gen tool ([Ladle](https://ladle.dev/)) Vojtech created to address this, and ultimately helping developers get closer to what end users experience.
