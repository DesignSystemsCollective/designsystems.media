In this episode, we brought in [Luis](https://twitter.com/luis_klefsjo), who, aside from being Head of Product Design at [YLD](https://www.yld.io), also runs [Design Systems London](https://twitter.com/DSLconf)....which happens to be where your hosts Dan & Dan met. We go on a fair bit of a journey from Luis' windy career path to how design systems work in a consultancy model, to the events...and what they'd do if the world were without the Internet

Got a suggestion for another guest or want to lavish untold amounts of praise for our ramblings? Give us a follow on the bird site [@WhatTheDS](https:%20//twitter.com/WhatTheDS)
