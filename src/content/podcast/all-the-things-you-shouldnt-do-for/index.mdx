I'm thrilled to have the one and only Dan Mall on the show, and in this episode, we get deep into all the things you maybe _don't_ want to do if you want your design system to be successful. **Dan shares his experiences with failed design systems, one very failed attempt at pitching a system to leadership,¬† why he thinks design systems should be specific not generic and maybe... not include foundations?** Plus, we talk about useless documentation, what's next for systems, and THE spiciest take on tokens.

(Honestly, there are so many üå∂Ô∏è Spicy Takes‚Ñ¢Ô∏è in this episode, we might have to rename the show to Design System Spicy Takes!)
