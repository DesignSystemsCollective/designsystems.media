Navigating design system contributions – how do you tell someone their component is terrible?  

We address many design system creators' challenges: Navigating design system contributions and giving constructive feedback. How do you effectively communicate that a contributed component may not meet the standards or expectations (i.e., they’re just plain terrible)? We discuss ways to encourage improvement without demoralizing contributors. Join us as we explore best practices, real-life stories, and strategies for fostering collaboration and quality within your design system.
